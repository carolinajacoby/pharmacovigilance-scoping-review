Authors: Ana Carolina Jacoby, Mel Amisa Matsuda, Carine Raquel Blatt, S√≠lvio C√©sar Cazella

## Objective
To identify and describe the data mining algorithms used in pharmacovigilance studies to explore adverse drug events, based on real-world data from pharmacovigilance databases.

## Methodology: Scoping Review

The study was conducted following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines.

**Databases:** Pubmed, Embase, Scopus, Web Of Science.

**Collection Date:** July 16, 2025.

**Inclusion Criteria:** Publications between 2015 and 2025, in English, that apply data mining techniques to real data from pharmacovigilance databases.

**Research Question:** ‚ÄúWhich data mining algorithms have been described to explore adverse drug events in pharmacovigilance studies?‚Äù

**Protocol:** The study protocol is registered on the [Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://osf.io/kzjdt/)

## Requirements and Reproducibility
The analysis was performed using notebooks hosted on Google Colab, ensuring accessibility and ease of use.

Language: Python (Colab Environment)

Libraries: All necessary libraries are installed directly within the first cells of the notebooks using !pip install.
