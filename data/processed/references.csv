Methods: Data from the FAERS database since Brexanolone's approval in 2019 were extracted, categorizing and analyzing AEs based on frequency and signal strength. Signal detection was conducted using frequency and Bayesian methods to assess the statistical association between AEs and Brexanolone. Results: A total of 234 Brexanolone-related AE reports were collected. Signal detection results revealed a significant association between Brexanolone and multiple system-organ AEs. Intravenous infusion-related events were notably frequent, including Product Administration Error (35 cases), Incorrect Drug Monitoring Procedure (19 cases), Product Administration Interrupted (14 cases), Incorrect Product Administration Duration (11 cases), and Medication Error (10 cases). These findings indicate a need for more standardized management of Brexanolone administration in clinical practice. Common psychiatric AEs were identified, including Perinatal Depression, Intrusive Thoughts, Electroencephalogram Abnormality, Panic Disorder, Tearfulness, Self-Injurious Ideation, Sedation Complication, and Feelings of Despair. Of these, Tearfulness, Self-Injurious Ideation, Sedation Complication, Feelings of Despair, and Crying are known AEs of Brexanolone. Signal strengths for Perinatal Depression, Intrusive Thoughts, Electroencephalogram Abnormality, and Panic Disorder indicate new potential AEs. Conclusion: The introduction of Brexanolone has brought new hope to postpartum depression treatment, yet the study identifies a range of AEs, particularly associated with intravenous infusion and mental status changes, emphasizing caution in clinical application.","2025","2025-09-23 17:07:59","2025-09-23 17:07:59","","186-193","","","382","","J.

However, limited clinical research and inconsistent results have hindered a comprehensive understanding of this issue. This study seeks to elucidate gender and age differences in cardiac-related adverse reactions, aiming to offer scientific evidence to inform clinical practice. Design A retrospective pharmacovigilance study. Setting Based on the reports of ICIs in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database from 2003-2023, we conducted a disproportionality analysis to identify cardiac immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and explored the correlation of age and gender with these adverse events. Main outcome measures The main cardiac irAEs were defined by four preferred terms: myocarditis, atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure and pericardial effusion. Both the proportional reporting ratio (PRR) and reporting odds ratio (ROR) are frequency methods. Data mining was performed using the PRR method, which assesses the relative risk of adverse drug reactions by comparing the frequency of reports associating a specific drug with a particular adverse reaction to the frequency of reports linking any drug to the same reaction. A higher PRR indicates a more robust adverse event signal, suggesting a stronger statistical association between the drug of interest and the target adverse event. In the research process, we primarily used the ROR and PRR from disproportionality analysis to screen for cardiac irAEs, while also elucidating the correlation between these reactions and factors such as age and gender. Results A total of 2033 adverse events were retrieved, and myocarditis was the most common cardiac irAEs. Gender disparities exist in the incidence of various adverse reactions to the same medication. Female patients need to be particularly vigilant for cardiac adverse events when taking atezolizumab, and male patients should be especially cautious for cardiac adverse events when using ipilimumab. Furthermore, ipilimumab produced a positive signal for pericardial effusion in the elderly group but not in the younger group, suggesting that elderly patients may be more susceptible to adverse reactions. Therefore, increased vigilance and careful monitoring are warranted during clinical administration of this medication to elderly patients. Conclusion Our study highlights the gender and age differences in cardiac adverse events with ICIs, providing valuable insights for clinical application.","2025","2025-09-23 17:07:59","2025-09-23 17:07:59","","","","6","15","","BMJ Open","","","","","","","","English","","","","rayyan-281079733","","","","","/home/carolina/Zotero/storage/ELT7IHCN/Shan et al. - 2025 - Gender and age disparities in cardiac immune-related adverse events associated with immune checkpoin.pdf","","adolescent; adult; adverse drug reaction; age distribution; aged; article; atezolizumab; atrial fibrillation; avelumab; cardiotoxicity; cemiplimab; child; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; data mining; drug monitoring; durvalumab; female; Food and Drug Administration; heart failure; human; immune checkpoint inhibitor; immunopathology; infant; ipilimumab; major clinical study; male; myocarditis; newborn; nivolumab; pembrolizumab; pericardial effusion; pharmacovigilance; retrospective study; sex difference; signal detection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our research objective was to evaluate the safety characteristics of TAF in practical settings by analyzing data from the FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS) database maintained by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Method In our investigation, we examined the uneven distribution of adverse events associated with TAF by employing statistical metrics including the Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), and Gamma-Poisson Shrinker (GPS) to determine their significance. Results Out of the 57692002 case reports in the FAERS database, 1911 reported TAF as a major suspected (PS) adverse events (AEs). A disproportionate analysis identified 43 preferred terms (PTs) related to TAF. It is worth noting that we have observed unexpected significant adverse events, such as cerebral infarction, bone pain, swallowing difficulties, drug resistance, dementia, etc., which are not mentioned in the drug instructions. Conclusion These findings unearth novel neurological, metabolic, and resistance - related risks, thereby necessitating a marked increase in clinical vigilance. The identification of signals related to cerebral infarction and dementia implies potential vascular/metabolic interplay, highlighting the importance of lipid monitoring among long - term tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) users. In response, healthcare providers should prioritize strengthening the monitoring of neurological symptoms and lipid profiles, reevaluating bone health assessment and management protocols especially in high - risk populations, and providing support to enhance patient adherence to mitigate resistance risks. This analysis offers crucial post - marketing evidence, which is instrumental in optimizing the risk - benefit balance of TAF in the long - term management of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.","2025","2025-09-23 17:07:59","2025-09-23 17:07:59","","","","6","20","","Plos One.","","","","","","","","English","","","","rayyan-281079734","","","","","/home/carolina/Zotero/storage/Y8JH9V5C/Zhang et al. - 2025 - A real-world disproportionality analysis of Tenofovir Alafenamide (TAF) Data mining of the FDA adve.pdf","","adult; adverse drug reaction; aged; article; data mining; female; Food and Drug Administration; human; male; pharmacovigilance; breast disease; connective tissue disease; data base; drug approval; drug safety; ear disease; eye disease; gastrointestinal disease; heart disease; kidney disease; mental disease; musculoskeletal disease; neurologic disease; psychiatric complication; skin disease; vascular disease; fatigue; middle aged; Bayesian network; United States; Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems; Article; Data Mining; Databases, Factual; factual database; hospitalization; Humans; proportional reporting ratio; statistical analysis; United States Food and Drug Administration; Bayes theorem; data analysis software; drug efficacy; *Data Mining; antivirus agent; death; dementia; outcome assessment; Bayes Theorem; bone pain; lymphatic system disease; Bayesian confidence propagation neural network; hepatobiliary disease; injury; polyp; hepatitis B; incidence; health care personnel; brain infarction; very elderly; dysphagia; procedural site reaction; Antiviral Agents; neoplasm; pharmacist; system organ class; *Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems/statistics & numerical data; adenine; ]; *Adenine/analogs & derivatives/adverse effects/therapeutic use; *Antiviral Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use; *Tenofovir/analogs & derivatives/adverse effects; Adenine; alanine; Alanine; connective tissue; disability assessment; gamma poisson shrinker; Hepatitis B virus; high risk population; immune complex disease; infections associated with other infections or conditions; labyrinthitis; life threat; lipid fingerprinting; organ systems; Poisson distribution; reproductive health; tenofovir; Tenofovir; tenofovir alafenamide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate adverse drug events (ADEs) associated with baloxavir marboxil by analyzing the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. Methods: Adverse event reports involving baloxavir marboxil were extracted from the FAERS database spanning the fourth quarter of 2018 to the third quarter of 2023. Demographic characteristics and reporter profiles were analyzed to characterize the exposed population. A disproportionality analysis was performed using four validated pharmacovigilance algorithms: reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), and multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS). These complementary approaches were employed to detect, prioritize, and validate potential safety signals. Results: Analysis of 8,824,675 ADE reports from the FAERS database identified 1,654 cases (0.19%) associated with baloxavir marboxil. Pediatric patients (< 18 years) exhibited the highest ADE reporting rate. Geospatial analysis revealed marked clustering, with 98.97% of reports originating from the United States (63.2%) and Japan (35.77%). We detected 47 significant safety signals spanning 27 System Organ Classes (SOCs), including established reactions such as pneumonia (n = 90) and vomiting (n = 77). Novel signals emerging from the analysis comprised hemorrhagic diathesis (n = 3), rhabdomyolysis (n = 25), hepatic dysfunction (n = 13), and cardiorespiratory arrest (n = 7). Notably, bleeding-related events (e.g., ischemic colitis, IC025 = 5.03) and neurological complications (e.g., febrile delirium, IC025 = 9.12) demonstrated statistically significant associations. Conclusion: This pharmacovigilance study identifies previously undercharacterized safety signals associated with baloxavir marboxil, including hemorrhagic complications, liver dysfunction, rhabdomyolysis, and life-threatening cardiorespiratory events. Pediatric populations and patients on anticoagulants may require heightened monitoring. While these findings provide critical pharmacovigilance insights, our study is inherently constrained by the spontaneous reporting system, which introduces potential underreporting, reporting biases, and confounding factors. Future research could employ more rigorous prospective study designs, integrating clinical trials and epidemiological studies, to more accurately assess the safety risks of baloxavir marboxil.","2025","2025-09-23 17:07:59","2025-09-23 17:07:59","","","","1","26","","BMC Pharmacol.

This study aimed to evaluate the adverse events (AEs) of IDH inhibitors based on the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. Methods: AE reports for IDH inhibitors (enasidenib, ivosidenib, and olutasidenib) were collected and analyzed from the time of launch through the first quarter of 2024. Only IDH inhibitors reported as the target drug and coded as the primary suspect (PS) were included in the analysis. AEs were standardized and classified according to the preferred term (PT) and system organ classification (SOC) in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 26.0. Disproportionality analyses including the reporting odds ratio and the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network were performed in data mining to assess IDH inhibitor-relatedAEs. Differentiation syndrome was the AE of special interest. Results: The reports number of enasidenib, ivosidenib, and olutasidenib was 11 616 357, 10 067 250, and 2 563 464, respectively. A total of 80 enasidenib-related signals involving 15 SOCs, 78 ivosidenib-related signals involving 17 SOCs, and 7 olutasidenib-related signals involving 4 SOCs were obtained. The most signals reported were “blood and lymphatic system disorders,” “infections and infestations,” and “nervous system disorders” in enasidenib. For signals of ivosidenib, the most frequently reported were “gastrointestinal disorders,” “general disorders and administration site conditions,” and “injury, poisoning and procedural complications.” Ivosidenib was the only IDH inhibitor with signals in “cardiac disorders.” Differentiation syndrome events were reported in 89, 40, and 2 cases for enasidenib, ivosidenib, and olutasidenib, respectively. The median time to onset was 26–31 days for ivosidenib and enasidenib. AML was the most common indication in the differentiation syndrome reports. Conclusions: Our study identifies potential AE signals associated with IDH inhibitors and provides a broader understanding of the safety. The safety profiles highlight the need for long-term safety monitoring of IDH inhibitor recipients. Promptly monitoring and intervention in specific organ systems depending on the type of IDH inhibitor may improve the overall survival or enhance the quality of life. In the future, it will be necessary to validate our findings in prospective large-scale studies and to investigate the underlying mechanisms.","2025","2025-09-23 17:07:59","2025-09-23 17:07:59","","","","1","11","","Future J.

Disproportionality analyses employing both frequentist (Reporting Odds Ratio, Proportional Reporting Ratio) and Bayesian approaches were performed. Drug-drug interactions were assessed using multiplicative drug-drug interaction model. Additionally, we reviewed published case reports of DPP-4i-associated angioedema. Results: Analysis of 29,163,222 reports identified 588 cases of DPP-4i-associated angioedema. Significant safety signals were detected for DPP-4i monotherapies, while combinations with RAAS-interfering drugs demonstrated stronger signals through both frequentist and Bayesian analyses. Significant interaction signals were observed for sitagliptin/irbesartan, sitagliptin/valsartan, linagliptin/valsartan and alogliptin/lisinopril combinations. Alogliptin/lisinopril and sitagliptin/irbesartan combinations showed the highest risk profiles. Angioedema occurred predominantly in elderly patients (> 65 years) and females. Sixteen case reports corroborated the findings from the database assessment. Clinical outcomes were comparable between monotherapy and combination therapy groups. Conclusion: This pharmacovigilance analysis reveals significant safety signals for angioedema with specific DPP-4i combinations with RAAS-interfering drugs, suggesting potential drug-drug interactions. These findings emphasize the need for careful patient monitoring, particularly in vulnerable populations, when prescribing these combinations. Further prospective studies are warranted to validate these findings and establish definitive causal relationships.","2025","2025-09-23 17:07:59","2025-09-23 17:07:59","","","","1","17","","Diabetol.

However, real-world studies assessing its safety in large populations are lacking. As such, this study aimed to comprehensively evaluate real-world adverse drug events (ADEs) linked to paliperidone palmitate by employing data mining techniques on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database and the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database. Methods: The study retrieved ADE reports from the FAERS database covering the period from 2009 through the third quarter of 2024, and from the JADER database covering the period from 2013 through the second quarter of 2024. Utilizing disproportionality analyses such as the reporting odds ratios (ROR), proportional reporting ratios (PRR), Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), and multi-item Poisson shrinkage (MGPS), significant associations between ADEs and paliperidone palmitate were evaluated. Results: A total of 27,672 ADE reports related to paliperidone palmitate were identified in FAERS, with 285 significantly disproportionate preferred terms (PTs) identified by all four algorithms. Paliperidone palmitate-associated ADEs encompassed 27 System Organ Classes (SOCs). The top three PTs with the highest reported cases were off-label use, drug ineffective, and hospitalization. Common ADEs included increased blood prolactin, galactorrhea, and schizophrenia, which was consistent with drug label. Noteworthy, unexpected signals not listed in the drug label were also identified, such as psychosexual disorders, prolactin-producing pituitary tumors, suicide attempt, and sudden death. The median onset time for all ADEs was 40 days. Furthermore, gender-based difference in risk signals was detected. Females are more likely to experience elevated blood prolactin and weight increase, whereas males are more prone to sexual dysfunction. Among the 1,065 ADE reports from the JADER database, we identified 51 positive signals, 35 of which overlapped with those found in FAERS, including schizophrenia, hyperprolactinemia, and erectile dysfunction. Conclusion: The study findings from two independent databases serve as crucial references for ensuring the safe of paliperidone palmitate. Additionally, the gender-specific monitoring references provided can enhance clinical surveillance efforts and facilitate more effective risk identification.","2025","2025-09-23 17:07:58","2025-09-23 17:07:58","","","","1","25","","BMC Psychiatry","","","","","","","","English","","","","rayyan-281079721","","","","","/home/carolina/Zotero/storage/D66ZQZ6X/Lou et al. - 2025 - A multidimensional assessment of adverse events associated with paliperidone palmitate a real-world.pdf","","adolescent; adult; adverse drug reaction; aged; article; data mining; female; Food and Drug Administration; human; major clinical study; male; pharmacovigilance; data base; algorithm; middle aged; side effect; adverse event; Bayesian network; clinical monitoring; Japan; United States; accuracy; Adolescent; ADOLESCENTS; Adult; Adverse drug events; Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems; Aged; Antipsychotic Agents; ANTIPSYCHOTICS; Article; bayesian confidence propagation neural network; body weight gain; calculation; CARE RESOURCE UTILIZATION; Data Mining; Databases, Factual; Disproportionality analysis; drug interaction; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; epidemiology; erectile dysfunction; EXTENDED-RELEASE; factual database; FAERS; Female; FORMULATION; galactorrhea; hospitalization; Humans; hyperprolactinemia; JADER; Japanese (people); Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report; Male; Middle Aged; multi item poisson shrinkage; multidimensional scaling; nerve cell network; neuroleptic agent; off label drug use; OPEN-LABEL; paliperidone; Paliperidone palmitate; Paliperidone Palmitate; Pharmacovigilance; prolactin blood level; prolactinoma; proportional reporting ratio; psychosexual disorder; Real-world analysis; RELAPSE PREVENTION; reporting odds ratio; RISK; SAFETY; schizophrenia; SCHIZOPHRENIA; self report; sexual dysfunction; statistical analysis; sudden death; suicide attempt; treatment response time; United States Food and Drug Administration; young adult; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aimed to analyze the RASI-related AKI or hyperkalemia reported in the Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database to optimize patients' treatment and provide a reference for a clinically safe and rational prescription. Methods: We obtained data in FAERS recorded from January 2004 to December 2020. Disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis were used in data mining to screen the suspected AKI or hyperkalemia after RASI. The time to onset, hospitalization, and prognosis of RASI-associated AKI or hyperkalemia were also investigated. Results: We identified 11,301 RASI-related adverse events (AEs) of hyperkalemia and AKI in the FAERS database; 4997 were due to Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), 5658 were due to angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and 646 were due to the combination of ACEI and ARB. AKI was more commonly reported in patients with ARB (78.42%) than ACEI users (57.27%). Hyperkalemia cases were reported more in ACEI users (28.70%) than ARB users (14.14%). The median time to onset of RAS-associated AKI was 135.0 (17.0-620.0) days. RASI-associated hyperkalemia occurred relatively later in ACEI users, with a median onset time of 261.0 (43.0-1097.7) days, compared with that of 200.5 (52.0-636.0) days in ARB users (p < 0.001). Among all AEs, 72.39% of cases received hospitalization. Death occurred in 6.3% of the renal AE cases. The elderly and heart failure were potential risk factors for death in patients who developed RASI-associated renal AEs, with an increased Odds Ratio (OR) compared with younger age (OR = 1.32) and hypertension patients (OR = 2.55). Based on the criteria of the four algorithms, the ACEI and ARB combination further increased the incidence of AKI and hyperkalemia, demonstrating the highest Reporting Odds Ratios (RORs), Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRRs) and Empirical Bayesian Geometric Average (EBGMs). Conclusions: Patients who indicated RASI for heart failure demonstrated a higher death risk when AEs occurred. ACEI combined with ARB can increase the incidence of hyperkalemia and AKI. Careful and individualized management is necessary.","2023","2025-09-23 17:08:17","2025-09-23 17:08:17","","","","4","24","","Rev. Cardiovasc.

Methods: We collected data from FAERS from January 2004 to November 2022 and mined AE signals for Dmab and ZA using ROR values. We compared signal intensity for same AEs and investigated off-label use. We also examined their AEs in adjuvant therapy for breast and prostate cancer. Results: 154,735 reports of primary suspect drugs were analyzed in the FAERS database (Dmab: 117,857; ZA: 36,878). Dmab and ZA had 333 and 1,379 AE signals, with 189 overlaps. The AEs of Dmab included death (ROR:3.478), osteonecrosis of jaw (ROR:53.025), back pain (ROR:2.432), tooth disorder (ROR:16.18), bone pain (ROR:6.523). For ZA, the AEs included osteonecrosis (ROR:104.866), death (ROR: 3.645), pain (ROR:3.963), osteonecrosis of jaw (ROR: 91.744), tooth extraction (ROR: 142.143). Among overlap signals, Dmab showed higher strength in exostosis of the jaw (ROR: 182.66 vs. 5.769), atypical fractures (ROR: 55.589 vs. 9.123), and atypical femur fractures (ROR:49.824 vs. 4.968). And ZA exhibited stronger associations in abscess jaw (ROR: 84.119 vs. 11.12), gingival ulceration (ROR: 74.125 vs. 4.827), increased bone formation (ROR: 69.344 vs. 3.218). Additionally, we identified 528 off-label uses for Dmab and 206 for ZA, with Dmab mainly used in prostate cancer (1.04%), breast cancer (1.03%), and arthritis (0.42%), while ZA in breast cancer (3.21%), prostate cancer (2.48%), and neoplasm malignant (0.52%). For Dmab in breast cancer treatment, AEs included death (11.6%), disease progression (3.3%), and neutropenia (2.7%), while for ZA included death (19.8%), emotional disorder (12.9%), osteomyelitis (11.7%). For prostate cancer treatment, Dmab`s AEs were death (8.9%), prostate cancer metastatic (1.6%), renal impairment (1.7%), while ZA`s included death (34.4%), general physical health deterioration (19.9%), and hemoglobin decreased (18.9%). Conclusion: Our analysis of FAERS database provided postmarketing surveillance data and revealed different strengths of reported AE signals between Dmab and ZA in some of their common AEs. It’s also worth noting that both drugs have potential off-label applications, which could introduce new AEs. This highlights the necessity for safety monitoring when using Dmab and ZA off-label.","2023","2025-09-23 17:08:17","2025-09-23 17:08:17","","","","","14","","Front.

However, relatively little is known regarding voriconazole-induced cSCC in Japan. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between voriconazole use and cSCC in Japan using different national pharmacovigilance databases. First, using the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database, we evaluated the association between voriconazole use and cSCC in Japan. Second, using the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, we examined regional differences in the occurrence of voriconazole-induced cSCC between Japan and other countries. We calculated reporting odds ratios (RORs) as disproportionality analysis to evaluate voriconazole-induced cSCC. In this study, cases in which one or more of ""Bowen's disease"", ""Carcinoma in situ of skin"", ""Keratoacanthoma"", ""Squamous cell carcinoma in skin"", or ""Squamous cell carcinoma"" were reported as adverse events were considered to be cSCC cases. The analysis based on the JADER database showed an association between voriconazole use and cSCC in Japan, with a ROR (95% confidence interval) of 35.37 (25.60-48.87). Further, the analysis based on the FAERS database revealed that signals were detected in Japan as well as in Western countries and Australia. This study is the first in which the association between voriconazole use and cSCC in Japan is assessed using national pharmacovigilance databases. Healthcare providers need to be fully aware of the potential for cSCC development owing to voriconazole use and in all countries, including Japan, ensure careful follow-up of patients' skin.","2022","2025-09-23 17:08:16","2025-09-23 17:08:16","","307-310","","10","77","","Pharmazie","","","","","","","","English","","","","rayyan-281079862","","","","","/home/carolina/Zotero/storage/DY8QDH9I/Tanaka et al. - 2022 - Occurrence of voriconazole-induced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in Japan data mining from diff.pdf","","adult; aged; article; data mining; female; human; male; pharmacovigilance; sex difference; drug safety; drug use; adverse event; Japan; disease association; Bowen disease; clinical article; immunocompromised patient; keratoacanthoma; squamous cell skin carcinoma; voriconazole","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compared to minocycline (ROR 5.5, 95% CI 4.94–6.12; IC 2.35, 95% CI 1.98–2.68) and doxycycline (ROR 1.91, 95% CI 1.71–2.12; IC 0.91, 95% CI 0.55–1.26), tigecycline showed a stronger association with hepatocellular injury (ROR 7.11, 95% CI 6.13–8.23; IC 2.68, 95% CI 2.16–3.13). Tigecycline also showed a stronger association with cholestatic injury (ROR 12.16, 95% CI 10.13–14.61; IC 3.51, 95% CI 2.79–4) than minocycline (ROR 3.23, 95% CI 2.59–4.04; IC 1.67, 95% CI 0.9–2.37) or doxycycline (ROR 2.86, 95% CI 2.47–3.31; IC 1.5, 95% CI 1–1.97). Tigecycline (ROR 6.56, 95% CI 4.57–9.41; IC 2.69, 95% CI 1.28–3.64) and minocycline (ROR 4.22, 95% CI 3.14–5.66; IC 2.06, 95% CI 1–2.93) showed a significant association with liver failure. Conclusion The data mining of FAERS suggested an association between DILI and tigecycline, minocycline, and doxycycline.","2022","2025-09-23 17:08:16","2025-09-23 17:08:16","","709-716","","3","44","","Int.

Methods: We performed disproportionality and Bayesian analyses based on data from the first quarter in 2004 to the third quarter in 2021 in the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System to characterize the signal differences of antifungal drugs-related DILI. We also compared the onset time and mortality differences of different antifungal agents. Results: A total of 2943 antifungal drugs-related DILI were identified. Affected patients tended to be aged >45 years (51.38%), with more males than females (49.03% vs. 38.09%). Antifungal drug-induced liver injury is most commonly reported with voriconazole (32.45%), fluconazole (19.37%), and itraconazole (14.51%). Almost all antifungal drugs were shown to be associated with DILI under disproportionality and Bayesian analyses. The intraclass analysis of correlation between different antifungal agents and DILI showed the following ranking: caspofungin (ROR = 6.12; 95%CI: 5.36–6.98) > anidulafungin (5.15; 3.69–7.18) > itraconazole (5.06; 4.58–5.60) > voriconazole (4.58; 4.29–4.90) > micafungin (4.53; 3.89–5.27) > posaconazole (3.99; 3.47–4.59) > fluconazole (3.19; 2.93–3.47) > ketoconazole (2.28; 1.96–2.64). The onset time of DILI was significantly different among different antifungal drugs (p < 0.0001), and anidulafungin result in the highest mortality rate (50.00%), while ketoconazole has the lowest mortality rate (9.60%). Conclusion: Based on the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database, antifungal drugs are significantly associated with DILI, and itraconazole and voriconazole had the greatest risk of liver injury. Due to indication bias, more clinical studies are needed to confirm the safety of echinocandins.","2022","2025-09-23 17:08:16","2025-09-23 17:08:16","","","","","13","","Front.

The current study was to assess axitinib-related adverse events (AEs) through data mining of the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Methods: Disproportionality analyses, including the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), and the multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS) algorithms, were employed to quantify the signals of axitinib-associated AEs. Results: Out of 10,703,806 reports collected from the FAERS database, 9044 reports of axitinib as the ‘primary suspected (PS)’ AEs were identified. Axitinib induced AEs occurrence targeted 26 organ systems. A total of 95 significant disproportionality PTs conforming to the four algorithms were simultaneously retained. Rare reports and significant signals of aortic disease have emerged. Unexpected significant AEs such as scrotal swelling, scrotal ulcers, infections, and infestations might also occur. The median onset time of axitinib-associated AEs was 63.5 days (interquartile range [IQR] 20–182 days), and most of the cases occurred within the first one and 2 months after axitinib initiation. Conclusion: Our study found potential new AEs signals and might provide important support for clinical monitoring and risk identification of axitinib.","2022","2025-09-23 17:08:16","2025-09-23 17:08:16","","563-572","","4","21","","Expert Opin.

Too few drugs included in the criteria cannot guarantee the safety of medication for the elderly. Too many drugs included in the criteria will result in less selective medication for the elderly. This paper uses real-world data to evaluate the relationship between antihypertensive drugs and falls, so as to provide references for experts and scholars to revise the criteria of potentially inappropriate medications for the elderly and clinical safe medication. Method: We use the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FDA FAERS) to evaluate the association between specific antihypertensive drugs in six categories (alpha-1 receptor blockers (α-1 blockers), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-receptor blockers (β-blockers), and diuretics) and falls by data mining algorithms, including the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), and the empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM) and compared with the relevant drugs included in the Beers Criteria and STOPP/START Criteria. Result: There are a total of 5,157,172 co-occurrences found in 973,447 reports aged 65 years or older from 2016 to 2019 in the FDA FAERS database, and the number of co-occurrences of falls is 5917 for the six categories of 51 antihypertensive drugs. Four kinds of mining methods overlap detection of 12 kinds of positive signal drugs, none of which are not included in the Beers Criteria and 7 drugs are included in the STOPP/START Criteria; 1–3 kinds of mining methods overlap detection of positive signal drugs, a total of 12 kinds, and one drug is included in the Beers Criteria and 5 drugs are included in the STOPP/START Criteria; 22 drugs have fall adverse events, but no positive signal is detected, and 13 drugs are included in STOPP/START Criteria; and 5 drugs have no fall adverse events and 3 drugs are included in the STOPP/START Criteria. Conclusion: The FAERS database was used to confirm the potential connection between some antihypertensive drugs and fall adverse events through data mining algorithms. The Beers Criteria did not clearly indicate the antihypertensive drugs that caused falls, and the antihypertensive drugs included in the STOPP/START Criteria were too extensive and did not include β-blockers and diuretics. It is recommended that experts and scholars use real-world data (such as FAERS, EudraVigilance, WHO VigiBase, and so on) to further explore the relationship between specific antihypertensive drugs and falls in the elderly, so as to revise and improve the criteria for inappropriate medications for the elderly.","2021","2025-09-23 17:08:16","2025-09-23 17:08:16","","1147-1156","","8","77","","Eur.

In addition, other adverse events, such as bone marrow toxicity and peripheral neuropathy, can lead to chemotherapy discontinuation. This study aimed to evaluate the safety of taxanes in the real world.Methods:Taxane-associated adverse events were identified by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Preferred Terms and analyzed and compared by mining the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System pharmacovigilance database from January 2004 to December 2019. Reported adverse events, such as hypersensitivity reaction, bone marrow toxicity, and peripheral neuropathy, were analyzed with the following signal detection algorithms: reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS), Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), and logistic regression methods. Adverse outcome events and death outcome rates were compared between different taxane groups using Pearson's χ2test, whereas significance was determined at P < 0.05 with a 95% confidence interval (CI).Results:A total of 966 reports of hypersensitivity reactions, 1109 reports of bone marrow toxicity, and 1374 reports of peripheral neuropathy were analyzed. Compared with paclitaxel and docetaxel, bone marrow toxicity following the use of nab-paclitaxel had the highest ROR of 6.45 (95% two-sided CI, 6.05-6.88), PRR of 5.66, (χ2= 4342.98), information component of 2.50 (95% one-sided CI = 2.34), and empirical Bayes geometric mean of 5.64 (95% one-sided CI = 5.34).

We aimed to examine carbamazepine- and oxcarbazepine-associated Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis, by data mining the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Methods: Reports in FAERs were analysed, from the first quarter of 2004 to the last quarter of 2019. Pharmacovigilance tools were employed for the quantitative detection of signals, where a signal represents a drug-associated adverse event, including the reporting odds ratio, proportional reporting ratio, an information component given by a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and the empirical Bayes geometric mean. Results: The total number of reports identified as Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis associated with carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine included in this study was 1231. FAERS reports associated with carbamazepine were 1048, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (n = 668) and toxic epidermal necrolysis(n = 380). FAERS reports associated with oxcarbazepine were 183, including 142 Stevens-Johnson syndrome and 41 toxic epidermal necrolysis reports. The risk for Stevens-Johnson syndrome is higher than for toxic epidermal necrolysis and carbamazepine is associated with a higher risk than oxcarbazepine.

From a clinical point of view, it is characterized by acute flare-ups of intense itching, eczematous pruritic lesions involving dry skin. Dupilumab is the only biologic agent approved to treat moderate to severe course of atopic dermatitis, which can be particularly severe during pregnancy causing distress and impacting on maternal and fetal health. However, there is a dearth of data concerning the safety profile of Dupilumab during gestation. Therefore, we took advantage of a large global pharmacovigilance database. From inception up to March 9, 2021, 94,065 adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from 37,848 unique reports were retrieved. Of these, 36 reports related to pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal ADR could be extracted from the pharmacovigilance database. More than half of reports (n = 21; 58.3%) were spontaneous abortion, followed by other events, including exposure to the drug during the pregnancy (n = 8; 22.2%). Two cases of abortion were reported. No studied pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal ADR was found to be associated with the use of Dupilumab. The only OR significantly greater than 1 was the OR associated with the risk of developing heterotopic pregnancy (21.66 [95% CrI 2.95-159.02]) even if the IC was highly imprecise (1.45 [95% CrI from -2.34 to 3.09]), probably because of the single case of heterotopic pregnancy reported. In conclusion, Dupilumab use appears safe during gestation. Further studies are needed, especially to better understand the mechanisms underlying the pharmacological actions and ADR of Dupilumab.","2021","2025-09-23 17:08:16","2025-09-23 17:08:16","","5448-5451","","17","25","","Eur.

Here, we identified and characterized significant colitis-associated with ICIs. Methods: Based on the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from January 2004 to December 2019, the disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis, including the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) and the multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS) algorithms were adopted to data mining of the suspected adverse events of colitis after ICIs administrating. Clinical characteristics of patients with ICIs-associated colitis and the time to onset of colitis following different ICI regimens were collected. Results: A total of 3786 reports of colitis adverse events were identified with ICIs. Seven ICI monotherapies were associated with the reporting of colitis. Statistically significant ROR, PRR, information component (IC), and empirical Bayesian geometric mean (EBGM) emerged for all ICI monotherapies and combination therapies. ICIs-associated colitis affected mostly male (53.51%), with a wide mean age range (60.65 to 72 years). Colitis adverse events were commonly reported in patients with melanoma and lung cancer. Adverse outcomes of colitis concerning ICI were mainly outcomes of hospitalization-initiated or prolonged and other serious. Among colitis cases, 17.43% cases of colitis concerning ICI lead to death. The adverse event of colitis occurred earliest in ipilimumab monotherapy with a median time to onset of 64.21 days (IQR: 27–69 days) among all monotherapies. Conclusions: ICI may lead to severe and disabling ICIs-associated colitis during therapy. Analysis of FAERS data identified signals for adverse events of colitis with ICI regimens.

Mining signals using the spontaneous reporting systems is a very effective method for single drug-induced AE monitoring as well as early detection of DDIs. The objective of this study was to compare signal detection algorithms for DDIs based on frequency statistical models. Methods: Five frequency statistical models: the Ω shrinkage measure, additive (risk difference), multiplicative (risk ratio), combination risk ratio, and chi-square statistics models were compared using the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database as the spontaneous reporting system in Japan. The drugs targeted for the survey are all registered and classified as “suspect drugs” in JADER, and the AEs targeted for this study were the same as those in a previous study on Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS). Results: Of 3924 pairs that reported SJS, the number of signals detected by the Ω shrinkage measure, additive, multiplicative, combination risk ratio, and chi-square statistics models was 712, 3298, 2252, 739, and 1289 pairs, respectively. Among the five models, the Ω shrinkage measure model showed the most conservative signal detection tendency. Conclusion: Specifically, caution should be exercised when the number of reports is low because results differ depending on the statistical models. This study will contribute to the selection of appropriate statistical models to detect signals of potential DDIs.","2020","2025-09-23 17:08:15","2025-09-23 17:08:15","","","","5","37","","Pharm.

We analysed AEs induced by adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept Methods: We used data from the Korea Institute of Drug Safety and Risk Management–Korea Adverse Events Reporting System Database (KIDS-KD) collected between 2005 and 2016. We used three different signal detection methods: proportional reporting ratio (PRR), reporting odds ratio (ROR), and information component (IC). The drug was compared with drug labels in the USA and Korea. Logistic regression analysis identified AEs that are more likely to occur with drug use. Results: Of the 5594 AEs identified, 350, 452, and 71 were related to adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept, respectively. We identified seven new signals, which were not listed on drug labels in either Korea or the USA, for AEs associated with the study drugs: two for adalimumab (medication error and drug failure), two for infliximab (palpitation and temperature sensation change), and three for etanercept (hyperkeratosis, acne, and thyroid neoplasm malignant). Injection site pain (OR 6.14, 95% CI 1.15–32.74) and alopecia (OR 4.54, 95% CI 1.16–17.77) for adalimumab, chest pain (OR 6.01, 95% CI 1.35–26.77) for infliximab, and uveitis (OR 10.11, 95% CI 1.13–90.77) for etanercept were more likely to be reported in patients with each TNFα inhibitor than in those without, respectively. Conclusions: Seven new signals that were not included in the current label were identified for TNFα inhibitors and should be updated and monitored.Key Points• Large-scale spontaneous AE reporting data and data mining techniques are useful for detecting signals of rare AEs as well as common AEs induced by drugs.• Drug labels should be updated to reflect signals that are newly discovered by continuous monitoring.","2020","2025-09-23 17:08:15","2025-09-23 17:08:15","","347-355","","2","39","","Clin.

The authors retrospectively investigated adverse events (AEs) by data-mining a self-reporting database to better understand toxicities, especially since it has been used during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: A reporting odds ratio (ROR) was used to detect the risk signals from the data in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adverse event reporting system database (FAERS). The definition relied on system organ class (SOCs) and preferred terms (PTs) by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Results: The search retrieved 1,598 baricitinib-associated cases within the reporting period: 86 PTs with significant disproportionality were retained. Infections including “herpes zoster”, “oral herpes” and “herpes virus infection” were found at a similar rate to those reported in trials, and such events were rare. Reports emerged for several thrombotic adverse events, while these events were also rare. Unexpected safety signals as opportunistic infections were detected. Serious outcomes as death and life-threatening outcomes accounted for 9.76% of the reported cases. Conclusions: The incidence of these AEs does not appear above the background expected.

Therefore, clarifying whether an AE is due to a specific suspect drug or drug-drug interaction (DDI) is useful information for proper use of drugs. Whereas previous reports on the search for drug-induced AEs with signal detection using spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs) are numerous, reports on drug interactions are limited. This is because in methods that use ""a safety signal indicator"" (signal), which is frequently used in pharmacovigilance, a huge number of combinations must be prepared when signal detection is performed, and each risk index must be calculated, which makes interaction search appear unrealistic. Objective: In this paper, we propose association rule mining (AR) using large dataset analysis as an alternative to the conventional methods (additive interaction model (AI) and multiplicative interaction model (MI)). Methods: The data source used was the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database. The combination of drugs for which the risk index is detected by the ""combination risk ratio (CR)"" as the target was assumed to be true data, and the accuracy of signal detection using the AR methods was evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, Youden's index, F-score. Results: Our experimental results targeting Stevens-Johnson syndrome indicate that AR has a sensitivity of 99.05%, specificity of 92.60%, Youden's index of 0.917, F-score of 0.876, AI has a sensitivity of 95.62%, specificity of 96.92%, Youden's index of 0.925, and F-score of 0.924, and MI has a sensitivity of 65.46%, specificity of 98.78%, Youden's index of 0.642, and F-score of 0.771. This result was about the same level as or higher than the conventional method. Conclusions: If you use similar calculation methods to create combinations from the database, not only for SJS, but for all AEs, the number of combinations would be so enormous that it would be difficult to perform the calculations. However, in the AR method, the ""Apriori algorithm"" is used to reduce the number of calculations. Thus, the proposed method has the same detection power as the conventional methods, with the significant advantage that its calculation process is simple.","2018","2025-09-23 17:08:15","2025-09-23 17:08:15","","","","","9","","Front.

Administration of ifosfamide can cause encephalopathy and other neurotoxic effects. The aim of this study was to obtain novel information on the onset profiles of ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy (IIE) considering other associated clinical factors using the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) databases. Methods: We analyzed the reports of encephalopathy between 2004 and 2018 from the FAERS and JADER databases. To define IIE, we used the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred terms and standardized queries. The reporting odds ratios (ROR) at 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to detect the signal for IIE and adjusted for covariates using a multivariate logistic regression technique. We evaluated the time-to-onset profile of IIE and used the association rule mining technique to discover undetected associations, such as potential risk factors. Results: In the FAERS database, the ROR (CI) for encephalopathy (preferred term, PT) and encephalopathy (standardized MedDRA queries, SMQ) was 56.58 (51.69–61.93) and 1.57 (1.48–1.67), respectively. In the JADER database, the ROR (95% CI) for encephalopathy (PT) and encephalopathy (SMQ) was 13.54 (9.91–18.50) and 1.24 (1.01–1.53), respectively. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed a significant contribution in IIE signal in the ≥ 60 year group (p = 0.00094; vs. < 60 year group) and ≥ 2000 mg/m2 dosage group (p = 0.00045; vs. < 2000 mg/m2 dosage group). The association rules of {ifosfamide, aprepitant} → {encephalopathy (SMQ)} demonstrated high lift values. The average dose of ifosfamide in patients with encephalopathy (PT) and without encephalopathy (PT) was 2022.8 ± 592.8 (mean ± standard deviation) and 1568.5 ± 703.2 mg/m2, respectively (p < 0.05). Encephalopathy within the first 7 days of ifosfamide administration was 94.1% for encephalopathy (PT) and 87.7% for encephalopathy (SMQ), respectively. Conclusions: The present analysis demonstrated that the incidence of encephalopathy with ifosfamide should be closely monitored for a short onset (within 7 days). The patients who are administered a high dose of ifosfamide or co-administrated aprepitant should be carefully monitored for the development of encephalopathy.","2019","2025-09-23 17:08:15","2025-09-23 17:08:15","","1097-1105","","5","84","","Cancer Chemother.

It is a modern method of detecting new reaction (which can be desired or undesired) of a drug. It facilitates early adverse drug reaction detection which enables health professionals to identify adverse events that may not have been identified in pre-marketing clinical trials. Vortioxetine, the first mixed serotonergic antidepressant was initially approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) on September 30, 2013 for the treatment of adults with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). This study was to identify the signal strength for vortioxetine associated ADRs using data mining technique in USFDA Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) database. Methodology Most commonly used three data mining algorithms, Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) and Information Component (IC) were selected for the study and they were applied retrospectively in USFDA AERS database from 2015Q1 to 2016Q3. A value of ROR-1.96SE > 1, PRR ≥ 2, IC- 2SD > 0 were considered as the positive signal. Result A study population of 61,22,000 were reported all over the world. Among which 3481 reactions were associated with vortioxetine which comprised of 632 unique events encompassed with 27 clinically relevant reactions. ROR, PRR and IC showed positive signal for weight loss, agitation, anger, ketoacidosis, insomnia and abnormal dreams. Conclusion The present study suggests that vortioxetine may result in these adverse events. Further pharmacoepidemiologic studies are necessary to confirm this conclusion and to improve the precision of the prevalence and/or the risk factors of this ADRs.","2017","2025-09-23 17:08:15","2025-09-23 17:08:15","","152-156","","","30","","Asian J.

Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of DIGH using spontaneous reporting system (SRS) databases. Methods: We analyzed reports of DIGH from SRS databases and calculated the reporting odds ratios (RORs) of suspected drugs (immunosuppressants, calcium channel blockers, and anticonvulsants). The SRS databases used were the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database. With the data, we evaluated the time-to-onset profile and the hazard type using the Weibull shape parameter (WSP). Furthermore, we used the association rule mining technique to discover undetected relationships such as possible risk factors. Results: The FAERS contained 5,821,716 reports. The RORs (95% confidence interval: CI) for cyclosporine, everolimus, sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, amlodipine, nifedipine, carbamazepine, clobazam, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, topiramate, and valproic acid, were 39.4 (95% CI: 30.3-51.2), 4.2 (1.7-10.0), 6.6 (2.5-17.7), 13.1 (7.2-23.2), 94.8 (80.0-112.9), 57.9 (35.7-94.0), 15.1 (10.3-22.3), 65.4 (33.8-126.7), 6.5 (3.6-11.8), 19.7 (8.8-44.0), 65.4 (52.4-82.9), 56.5 (21.1-151.7), 2.9 (1.1-7.7), and 17.5 (12.6-24.4), respectively. The JADER database contained 430,587 reports. The median time-to-onset of gingival hyperplasia values for immunosuppressants, calcium channel blockers, and anticonvulsants use were 71, 262, and 37 days, respectively. Furthermore, the 95% CI of the WSP β for anticonvulsants was over and excluded 1, which meant that they were wear-out failure type. Conclusions: Our results suggest that DIGH monitoring of patients administered immunosuppressants, calcium channel blockers, or anticonvulsants is important. We demonstrated the potential risk of DIGH following the long-term use of calcium channel blocker over approximately 260 days. Based on the results of the association rule mining approach, patients with intellectual disability who are administered phenytoin should be monitored carefully. We recommend that patients who experience symptoms related to DIGH should be closely monitored.","2017","2025-09-23 17:08:15","2025-09-23 17:08:15","","","","1","3","","J. Pharm.

However, there are only few studies using a consistent methodologic approach to study hepatotoxicity of a larger group of antidepress ants. We performed a quantitative signal detection analysis using data from the Uppsala Monitoring Centre from the WHO that records adverse drug reaction (ADR) data from worldwide sources; we retrieved substance- and country-specific (Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States) ADR data and calculated reporting odds ratios as measures for disproportionality within a case/noncase approach. To allow for identification of agents that cause severe forms of hepatotoxic ADRs, we used 2 terms of the MedDRA (""drug-related hepatic disorders-comprehensive search"" [DRHD-CS] and ""... -severe events only"" [DRHD-SEO]). Distribution of signals was heterogeneous throughout the different data sets, and consistent findings were present for only a few substances: agomelatine (AGM) and tianeptine as well as both positive control agents (amineptine, nefazodone) generated signals related to DRHD-CS and DRHD-SEO in all analyzed data sets. Tri- and tetracyclic antidepressants (here amitriptyline, clomipramine, mianserin, mirtazapine, trimipramine) were associated with hepatotoxicity in several data sets. Using 2 MedDRA terms did not allow for detection of agents that cause severe hepatotoxic ADR. Our results support the findings of previous, primarily literature-based, systematic analyses of hepatotoxicity related to antidepressive psychopharmacotherapy. No new safety information could be generated. Application of 2 MedDRA terms did not increase the substance-specific safety information.","2016","2025-09-23 17:08:15","2025-09-23 17:08:15","","769-778","","6","56","","J. Clin.

However, as a relatively new therapeutic agent,  the long-term safety profile and adverse event (AE) profile of BV require further  investigation. This study aimed to identify significant and unexpected AEs  associated with BV using data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)  and the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) databases. METHODS: Data on  BV-related AEs were extracted from the FAERS and JADER databases. Signal  detection was performed using the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and 95% confidence  intervals (95% CI). Risk signals were categorized according to system organ  classes (SOCs) and preferred terms (PTs) as defined by the Medical Dictionary for  Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 26.0. In addition, the onset times of  BV-related AEs were analyzed. RESULTS: Between 2004 and 2023, a total of 19,279  and 2,561 AEs related to BV were recorded in the FAERS and JADER databases,  respectively. At the SOC level, prominent signals in the FAERS database included  blood and lymphatic system disorders, benign, malignant, and unspecified  neoplasms (including cysts and polyps), as well as congenital, familial, and  genetic disorders. In the JADER database, the most notable signals involved  benign, malignant, and unspecified neoplasms, blood and lymphatic system  disorders, and nervous system disorders. At the PT level, the top five signals in  the FAERS database were peripheral motor neuropathy, peripheral sensory  neuropathy, pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, febrile bone marrow aplasia, and  polyneuropathy. Unexpected AEs included febrile bone marrow aplasia and  Guillain-Barré syndrome. In the JADER database, the top five signals included  peripheral motor neuropathy, peripheral sensory neuropathy, bacterial  gastroenteritis, febrile neutropenia and pneumonia, with unexpected AEs such as  left ventricular dysfunction, cardiomegaly, retinal detachment, and marasmus. The  median onset time of AEs was 22 days (interquartile range [IQR] 7-81 days) in  FAERS and 27 days (IQR 7-73 days) in JADER. CONCLUSION: The signal detection  results from the FAERS and JADER databases highlight the importance of monitoring  significant and unexpected AEs associated with BV, particularly in the early  stages of treatment. These findings contribute to enhancing the post-marketing  safety profile of BV and offer valuable insights for clinical risk management  strategies.","2025","2025-09-23 17:08:14","2025-09-23 17:08:14","","e0322378","","5","20","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","rayyan-281080038","","","","","/home/carolina/Zotero/storage/UCZLRYBW/Tan et al. - 2025 - Signal mining and analysis of adverse events of Brentuximab Vedotin base on FAERS and JADER database.pdf","","United States; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Male; United States Food and Drug Administration; *Data Mining; *Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/epidemiology; *Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems/statistics & numerical data; *Brentuximab Vedotin/adverse effects; *Immunoconjugates/adverse effects; Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy; Japan/epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Quantitative methods for analyzing spontaneous reporting material recorded in pharmacovigilance databases through data mining have been proposed in the last decades and are increasingly used to flag potential safety problems. While automated data mining is motivated by the usually huge size of pharmacovigilance databases, it does not systematically produce relevant alerts. Moreover, each detected signal requires appropriate assessment that may involve investigation of the whole therapeutic class. The goal of this article is to provide a methodology for comparing two detected signals. It is nested within the automated surveillance framework as (1) no extra information is required and (2) no simple inference on the actual risks can be extrapolated from spontaneous reporting data. We designed our methodology on the basis of two classical methods used for automated signal detection: the Bayesian Gamma Poisson Shrinker and the frequentist Proportional Reporting Ratio. A simulation study was conducted to assess the performances of both proposed methods. The latter were used to compare cardiovascular signals for two HIV treatments from the French pharmacovigilance database.","2016","2025-09-23 17:08:14","2025-09-23 17:08:14","","615-629","","2","25","","Stat Methods Med Res","","","","","","","","English","","","","rayyan-281079955","","","","","/home/carolina/Zotero/storage/VMS8UD3H/Tubert-Bitter et al. - 2016 - Comparison of two drug safety signals in a pharmacovigilance data mining framework.pdf","","data mining; human; factual database; Bayes theorem; drug surveillance program; comparative study; heart infarction; chemically induced; France; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; saquinavir; anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; nelfinavir","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to improve the efficiency of full database screening using a prediction model-based approach. Methods: A logistic regression-based prediction model containing 5 candidate predictors was developed and internally validated using the Summary of Product Characteristics as the gold standard for the outcome. All drug-ADR associations, with the exception of those related to vaccines, with a minimum of 3 reports formed the training data for the model. Performance was based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results were compared with the current method of database screening based on the number of previously analyzed associations. Results: A total of 25 026 unique drug-ADR associations formed the training data for the model. The final model contained all 5 candidate predictors (number of reports, disproportionality, reports from healthcare professionals, reports from marketing authorization holders, Naranjo score). The AUC for the full model was 0.740 (95% CI; 0.734–0.747). The internal validity was good based on the calibration curve and bootstrapping analysis (AUC after bootstrapping = 0.739). Compared with the old method, the AUC increased from 0.649 to 0.740, and the proportion of potential signals increased by approximately 50% (from 12.3% to 19.4%).

Conducting data mining on adverse events (AEs) of cilostazol in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database to explore its potential medication risks and advance more rational and secure clinical medication practices. Methods This study utilized the Open Vigil 2.1-MedDRA tool to retrieve and extract AE reporting data related to cilostazol from the FAERS database spanning the first quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2024. The primary methodology employed was the application of the reporting odds ratio (ROR) method to detect risk signals associated with AEs of cilostazol. Results A total of 2,130 AE reports involving cilostazol were identified as the primary suspect drug, with a total of 7,134 AEs reported. These reports were predominantly concentrated among patients aged 60 and above, with a higher occurrence in males compared to females. Japan ranked first among the reporting countries, and the majority of reports were submitted by healthcare professionals. Through the screening of cilostazol, a total of 323 positive risk signals for AEs were identified, encompassing 23 system organ classes (SOCs). A comparison with the existing cilostazol product label revealed 8 AEs that were not included based on the number of AE reports, and 19 AEs that were not included based on the strength of the risk signals. Cilostazol exhibited positive risk signals for AEs primarily affecting 8 organ systems based on the SOC classification. Among these, cardiac disorders ranked highest, with a total of 53 positive risk signals for cardiovascular-related AEs identified. In terms of the number of reports, cardiac failure ranked first, aligning with the black box warning issued by the FDA regarding cilostazol. The occurrence of adverse reactions related to cilostazol is primarily concentrated within the first month of treatment. However, a certain proportion of adverse reactions have been reported to occur after long-term use (exceeding 360 days) of cilostazol therapy. Conclusion Our results have further enriched the observations from existing clinical and real-world studies, uncovering new AE signals for cilostazol, including fall, cerebral infarction, pneumonia, loss of consciousness, acute kidney injury, renal impairment, renal failure, cardiac vein perforation, basal ganglia haematoma, cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome, et al. This study also highlights the significant impact of cilostazol on the cardiovascular system, necessitating close attention to potential cardiovascular toxicities. In addition to focusing on the short-term adverse reactions following cilostazol administration, thorough research into its long-term safety profile is also imperative. This study provides recommendations and guidance for the rational and safe clinical use of cilostazol. In the future, prospective studies are needed to explore the occurrence of related AEs further.

Disproportionality analysis was conducted, and the effect sizes were estimated by reporting odds ratios (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), and information component (IC). Multivariate logistic regression was performed to investigate the predictors of serious ADEs by estimating the odds ratio (OR). Serious events were more likely to be cardiovascular disorders (ROR 6.77, PRR 6.6, IC 2.37), urinary system disorders (ROR 5.56, PRR 5.22, IC 2.12), and platelet, bleeding, and clotting disorders (ROR 5.41, PRR 5.17, IC 2.06). The predictors may include age (OR 1.05), the number of concomitant medications (OR 1.44), concomitant proton pump inhibitors (OR 1.46) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (OR 1.38) use, and specific antibacterial classes, while multiple antibacterial therapy was associated with lower serious ADE risks. The sensitivity analysis also suggests the male sex (OR 1.18) as a potential predictor of serious ADEs.

Due to the limited literature on voluntarily reported safety outcomes for recently approved antidiabetic drugs, this study investigated adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Research Design and Methods: A disproportionality analysis of spontaneously reported ADRs was conducted. FAERS reports from January 1, 2012 to March 31, 2022 were compiled, allowing a 5-year buffer following drug approval in 2017. Reporting odds ratios were calculated for the top 10 ADRs, comparing new diabetic agents to the other approved drugs in their therapeutic class. Results: 127,525 reports were identified for newly approved antidiabetic medications listed as the primary suspect (PS). For sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, the odds of blood glucose increased, nausea, and dizziness being reported was greater for empagliflozin. Dapagliflozin was associated with greater reports of weight decreased. Canagliflozin was found to have a disproportionally higher number of reports for diabetic ketoacidosis, toe amputation, acute kidney injury, fungal infections, and osteomyelitis. Assessing glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, dulaglutide and semaglutide were associated with greater reports of gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions. Exenatide was disproportionally associated with injection site reactions and pancreatic carcinoma reports. Conclusion: Pharmacovigilance studies utilizing a large publicly available dataset allow an essential opportunity to evaluate the safety profile of antidiabetic drugs utilized in clinical practice.

Administration of statin therapy could reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease in individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), which was recognized by multipal clinical guidelines. But previous studies had conflicting results on whether the long-term use of statins could benefit the renal function in diabetic patients. Aim: To evaluate the association between statin treatment and Chronic Kidney Disease in DM patients. Methods: This is a retrospective disproportionality analysis and cohort study based on real-world data. All DM cases reported in US Food and Drug Administration adverse event reporting system (FAERS) between the first quarter of 2004 and the fourth quarter of 2022 were included. Disproportionality analyses were conducted by estimating the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and the information component (IC). We further compared the CKD odds ratio (OR) between the statins group and the other primary suspected drug group among the included diabetes mellitus cases. Results: We finally included 593647 DM cases from FAERS, 5113 (5.31%) CKD cases in the statins group and 8810 (1.77%) CKD cases in the control group. Data analysis showed that the statins group showed a significant CKD signal (ROR: 3.11, 95% CI: 3.00–3.22; IC: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.07–1.29). In case group with two or more statins treatment history, the CKD signal was even stronger (ROR: 19.56, 95% CI: 18.10–21.13; IC: 3.70, 95% CI:3.44–3.93) compared with cases with one statin treatment history. Conclusion: The impact of statin therapy on the progression of renal disease in individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) remains inconclusive. After data mining on the current FAERS dataset, we discovered significant signals between statin treatment and CKD in diabetic patients. Furthermore, the incidence rate of CKD was higher among DM patients who used statins compared to those who did not.

However, off-target effects may lead to severe adverse events. This study evaluated the neurotoxicity of ADCs using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. Research design and methods: Data were extracted from the FAERS database for 2004 Q1 to 2022 Q4. We analysed the clinical characteristics of ADC-related neurological adverse events (AEs). We used the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and proportional reporting ratio (PRR) for the disproportionality analysis to evaluate the potential association between AEs and ADCs. Results: A total of 562 cases of neurological AEs were attributed to ADCs. The median age was 65 years old [(Min; Max) = 3; 92]. Neurotoxic signals were detected in patients receiving brentuximab vedotin, enfortumab vedotin, polatuzumab vedotin, trastuzumab emtansine, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, inotuzumab ozogamicin, and trastuzumab deruxtecan. The payloads of brentuximab vedotin, enfortumab vedotin, polatuzumab vedotin, and trastuzumab emtansine were microtubule polymerization inhibitors, which are more likely to develop neurotoxicity. We also found that brentuximab vedotin- and gemtuzumab ozogamicin-related neurological AEs were more likely to result in serious outcomes. The eight most common ADC-related nervous system AE signals were peripheral neuropathy [ROR (95% CI) = 16.98 (14.94–19.30), PRR (95% CI) = 16.0 (14.21–18.09)], cerebral haemorrhage [ROR (95% CI) = 9.45 (7.01–12.73), PRR (95% CI) = 9.32 (6.95–12.50)], peripheral sensory neuropathy [ROR (95% CI) = 47.87 (33.13–69.19), PRR (95% CI) = 47.43 (32.93–68.30)], polyneuropathy [ROR (95% CI) = 26.01 (18.61–36.33), PRR (95% CI) = 25.75 (18.50–35.86)], encephalopathy [ROR (95% CI) = 5.16 (3.32–8.01), PRR (95% CI) = 5.14 (3.32–7.96)], progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [ROR (95% CI) = 22.67 (14.05–36.58), PRR (95% CI) = 22.52 (14.01–36.21)], taste disorder [ROR (95% CI) = 26.09 (15.92–42.76), PRR (95% CI) = 25.78 (15.83–42.00)], and guillain barrier syndrome [ROR (95% CI) = 17.844 (10.11–31.51), PRR (95% CI) = 17.79 (10.09–31.35)]. The mortality rate appeared to be relatively high concomitantly with AEs in the central nervous system. Conclusion: ADCs may increase the risk of neurotoxicity in cancer patients, leading to serious mortality. With the widespread application of newly launched ADC drugs, combining the FAERS data with other data sources is crucial for monitoring the neurotoxicity of ADCs. Further studies on the potential mechanisms and preventive measures for ADC-related neurotoxicity are necessary.

However, the long-term safety of rucaparib in large sample population was unknown. The presented study aimed to evaluate rucaparib-associated adverse events (AEs) according to the real-world pharmacovigilance database. Methods: Disproportionality analysis was conducted to assess the association between rucaparib and its AEs. Data were collected from the international pharmacovigilance database of US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) between January 2017 and June 2022. The characteristics of rucaparib-related AEs, and the onset time were further analyzed. Results: A total of 9,296,694 AE reports were recorded in the FAERS during the study period, among which 7,087 reports were associated with rucaparib. About 135 rucaparib-related AE signals in 15 system organ class (SOCs) were identified. The most common AEs included anaemia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, blood creatinine increase, alanine aminotransferase increase, and aspartate aminotransferase increase, which were listed in the label for rucaparib. Of note, 21 new and unexpected significant AEs that off-label were also found in our study, such as preferred term (PTs) of intestinal obstruction, gastrooesophageal reflux disease, blood iron decreased, dehydration, and hypersomnia. The median onset time of rucaparib-related AEs was 12 days (interquartile range [IQR] 1–62 days), and had early failure types.

This study aims to compare and appraise the performance of data mining algorithms used in signal detection. Method: Most commonly used three data mining algorithms (DMAs) (Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) and Information Component (IC)) were selected and applied retrospectively in USFDA Adverse Event Reporting System database to detect five confirmed Drug Event Combinations. They were selected in such a way that the drug is withdrawn from the market or label change between 2006-2015. A value of ROR-1.96SE>1, PRR≥2, χ2>4 or IC- 2SD>0 were considered as the positive signal. The data mining algorithms were compared for their sensitivity and early detection. Result: Among the three data mining algorithms, Information Component was found to have a maximum sensitivity (100%) followed by Reporting Odds Ratio (60%) and Proportional Reporting Ratio (40%). Sensitivity associated with the number of reports per drug event combination and early signal detection suggested that information component needs comparatively fewer reports to show positive signal than the other two data mining algorithms. ROR and PRR showed comparable results. Conclusion: Early detection of a reaction is possible using signal detection technique. Information component was found to be sensitive method compared with other two data mining algorithms in FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database. As the number of reports of drug event combination increased, the sensitivity and comparability of data mining algorithm also increased. © 2018 EManuscript Technologies.

Studies suggested conflicting results between PPI treatment and dementia event. This study examined the association between six PPI agents and dementia event by mining the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database from 2004 to 2020. We employed proportional reporting ratio (PRR) and information element (IC) methods to detect the signals of dementia relevant to PPI. We also analyzed characteristics of PPI and positive control reports, compared dementia event between long- and short-duration of PPI treatment.

However, ensuring the safety of GnRHas in real-world applications requires continuous vigilance. In light of this, we undertook a disproportionality analysis focused on adverse events (AEs) associated with GnRHas using data from both the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER). We evaluated GnRHas-associated AEs and characterized the clinical priority of unlisted AEs caused by each GnRHa from the different databases. Methods: In the disproportionality analysis, we applied two adjusted algorithms to identify signals related to GnRHas in the FAERS and JADER databases from 2004 to 2023. Additionally, we utilized the Statistical Analysis System (SAS, 9.4) to examine potential and high-aROR (adjusted reporting odds ratio) signals associated with GnRHas. We performed clinical priority assessment for suspicious PTs and an analysis of serious/non-serious outcomes. We also gathered information on the onset times of AEs linked with GnRHas from both databases. Results: From January 2004 to September 2023, FAERS and JADER recorded a total of 50,360,413 and 1,440,200 AEs, respectively. Employing two algorithms, the suspicious preferred terms (PTs) related to leuprolide (Leu) were 562 potential PTs (44 unlisted in specifications), followed by goserelin (Gos) with 189 PTs (28 unlisted), triptorelin (Tri) with 172 PTs (28 unlisted), and Leu-JADER with 85 PTs (10 unlisted). At the same PT level, the differences in GnRHas between the two databases were observed, such as cardiac failure, diabetes mellitus, liver disorder, dementia, suicidal ideation, interstitial lung disease, urinary disorders, and hypertensive crisis. In an analysis of serious vs. non-serious outcomes, a total of 43 AEs of Leu were more likely to be reported as serious AEs with p < 0.05 (such as asthenia, urinary retention, diabetes mellitus, interstitial lung disease, gait disturbance, and so on), following by Tri (6 AEs), and Gos (4 AEs). Based on the clinical priority score, 41 PTs of Leu, 26 PTs of Tri, 24 PTs of Gos, and 8 PTs of Leu-JADER were graded as weak. There were 3 PTs of Leu, 2 PTs of Tri, 4 PTs of Gos, and 2 PTs of Leu-JADER that were graded as moderate. Notably, in the assessment of the relevant evidence, 2 PTs (loss of libido and urinary tract toxicity caused by Leu), 1 PT (electrolyte imbalance caused by Tri), and 2 PTs (anorexia and suicidal ideation caused by Gos) showed a strong level of evidence with “++.” The differences in the signal strength of the same PTs from two databases were also worth noting. Moreover, the median onset time for GnRHas (Leu, Tri, and Gos) was 23 days (0, 298), 22 days (0, 181), and 217 days (29, 706), respectively, as median (Q1, Q3). Conclusion: An examination of two databases revealed suspicious AEs associated with GnRHas. Our study found potential new AE signals of GnRHas and supported continuous clinical monitoring, pharmacovigilance, regional differences, and further studies of GnRHas.

However, comprehensive evaluation of its long-term safety profile in a large sample population remains elusive. The current study assessed Tivozanib-related adverse events of real-world through data mining of the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System FDA Adverse Event Reporting System.Methods Disproportionality analyses, utilizing reporting odds ratio proportional reporting ratio Bayesian confidence propagation neural network and multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS) algorithms, were conducted to quantify signals of Tivozanib-related AEs. Weibull distribution was used to predict the varying risk incidence of AEs over time.Results Out of 5,361,420 reports collected from the FAERS database, 1,366 reports of Tivozanib-associated AEs were identified. A total of 94 significant disproportionality preferred terms (PTs) conforming to the four algorithms simultaneously were retained. The most common AEs included fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, blood pressure increased, decreased appetite, and dysphonia, consistent with prior specifications and clinical trials. Unexpected significant AEs such as dyspnea, constipation, pain in extremity, stomatitis, and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome was observed. The median onset time of Tivozanib-related AEs was 37 days (interquartile range [IQR] 11.75-91 days), with a majority (n = 127, 46.35%) occurring within the initial month following Tivozanib initiation.Conclusion Our observations align with clinical assertions regarding Tivozanib's safety profile. Additionally, we unveil potential novel and unexpected AE signatures associated with Tivozanib administration, highlighting the imperative for prospective clinical studies to validate these findings and elucidate their causal relationships. These results furnish valuable evidence to steer future clinical inquiries aimed at elucidating the safety profile of Tivozanib.","2024","2025-09-23 17:08:14","2025-09-23 17:08:14","0006-01-01","","","","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","rayyan-281088785","","","","","/home/carolina/Zotero/storage/329NRRQR/Wang et al. - 2024 - A real-world disproportionality analysis of Tivozanib data mining of the public version of FDA adver.pdf","","FAERS; OPEN-LABEL; adverse drug reactions; EFFICACY; adverse events; THERAPY; CROHNS-DISEASE; MAINTENANCE; ULCERATIVE-COLITIS; METAANALYSIS; RENAL-CELL CARCINOMA; ccRCC; MESALAZINE; Tivozanib; TREATMENT OPTIONS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As such, the current study is to assess disproportionate reporting of primary malignant lung cancer among reports for ACEIs submitted to the FDA adverse event reporting system utilizing a pharmacovigilance approach. We conducted a disproportionality analysis of primary malignant lung cancer adverse events associated with 10 ACEIs by calculating the reported odds ratios (ROR) and information component (IC) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). ROR was adjusted for sex, age, and reporting year by logistic regression analyses. From January 2004 to March 2020, a total of 622 cases of lung cancer adverse event reports were identified for ACEIs users. Significant disproportionate association was found for ACEIs as a drug class (ROR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.13-1.32; IC: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.17-0.39. adjusted ROR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.02-1.49). After stratification based on gender, a subset analysis suggested that female patients exhibited a significant disproportionate association, while male patients did not. Sensitivity analyses that limited the data by reporting region, comorbidity, and reporting year also showed similar trends. Statistical significant lung cancer signals were detected among patients who received ACEI, especially female patients. The disproportionality analysis of the FAERS database suggests mildly increased reporting of lung cancer among ACEI users. Further robust epidemiological studies are necessary to confirm this relationship.","2021","2025-09-23 17:08:14","2025-09-23 17:08:14","0002-01-01","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","rayyan-281088783","","","","","/home/carolina/Zotero/storage/H63RMVI7/Meng et al. - 2021 - Lung Cancer Adverse Events Reports for Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors Data Mining of the.pdf","","data mining; pharmacovigilance; FAERS; lung cancer; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A pharmacovigilance study","FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY","","1663-9812","10.3389/fphar.2022.967017","","Introduction: Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) produce unparalleled efficacy in refractory neoplasms but can also lead to serious toxicities. Although ADC-related sepsis has been reported, the clinical features are not well characterized in real-world studies.     Objective: The aim of this study was to identify the association between ADCs and sepsis using FAERS data and uncover the clinical characteristics of ADC-related sepsis.     Methods: We performed disproportionality analysis using FAERS data and compared rates of sepsis in cancer patients receiving ADCs vs. other regimens. Associations between ADCs and sepsis were assessed using reporting odds ratios (RORs) and information component (IC). For each treatment group, we detected drug interaction signals, and conducted subgroup analyses (age, gender, and regimens) and sensitivity analyses.     Results: A total of 24,618 cases were reported with ADCs between Q1, 2004 and Q3, 2021. Sepsis, septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and other sepsis-related toxicities were significantly associated with ADCs than other drugs in this database. Sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome have the highest safety concerns with ADCs compared with other anticancer monotherapies. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin and inotuzumab ozogamicin showed increased safety risks than other ADCs. For the top nine ADC-related sepsis, males showed higher sepsis safety concern than females (p <0.001); however, age did not exert influence on the risk of sepsis. We identified that 973 of 2,441 (39.9%) cases had acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 766 of 2613 (29.3%) cases on ADCs died during therapy. Time-to-onset analysis indicated ADC-related sepsis is prone to occur within a month after administration. Co-administration of ADCs with colony-stimulating factors, proton pump inhibitors, H2-receptor antagonists, or CYP3A4/5 inhibitors showed to synergistically increase the risk of sepsis-related toxicities.     Conclusion: Antibody-drug conjugates may increase the risk of sepsis in cancer patients, leading to high mortality. Further studies are warranted to characterize the underlying mechanisms and design preventive measures for ADC-related sepsis.","2022","2025-09-23 17:08:14","2025-09-23 17:08:14","0011-01-01","","","","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","rayyan-281088800","","","","","/home/carolina/Zotero/storage/QQG5AZZE/Xia et al. - 2022 - Do antibody-drug conjugates increase the risk of sepsis in cancer patients A pharmacovigilance stud.pdf","","data mining; pharmacovigilance; FAERS; sepsis; INHIBITORS; antibody-drug conjugates; OUTCOMES; TIME","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Four disproportionality analysis methods were employed to quantify the signals of capmatinib-related adverse events. The difference in capmatinib-associated adverse event signals was further investigated with respect to sex, age, weight, dose, onset time, continent, and concomitant drug. A total of 1518 reports and 4278 adverse events induced by capmatinib were identified. New significant adverse event signals emerged, such as dysphagia, dehydration, deafness, vocal cord paralysis, muscle disorder, and oesophageal stenosis. Notably, higher risk of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase increases were observed in females, especially when capmatinib was combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Compared with Europeans and Asians, Americans were more likely to experience peripheral swelling, especially in people > 65 years of age. Renal impairment and increased blood creatinine were more likely to occur with single doses above 400 mg and in Asians.

This study aimed to systematically evaluate the safety of durvalumab through data mining of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). We extracted reports of durvalumab as the primary suspected drug from the FAERS database (January 2017 to June 2024). Four disproportionality analysis algorithms were used to detect signals between durvalumab and adverse events (AEs). Durvalumab was recorded in 10,120 reports as the primary suspected drug. Of these, 43.6% of AEs occurred during the first month of treatment, with a median onset time of 40 days (IQR: 14-99 ). Among 181 potential signals, 64 were unexpected preferred terms not listed in the prescribing information, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS), pulmonary tuberculosis, radiation esophagitis, oesophageal fistula, oesophageal perforation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, cerebral infarction, biliary tract infection, cholecystitis, psoriasiform dermatitis, portal vein thrombosis, acute cholangitis and pericarditis malignant. Serious adverse events accounted for 93.3% of cases. Males exhibited a significantly higher risk of experiencing serious outcomes compared to females (OR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.52-2.19, P < 0.001). Older age groups demonstrated an elevated risk of severe outcomes relative to those under 65 years (65-74 years: OR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.15-2.00, P = 0.003; >= 75 years: OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.02-1.92, P = 0.038).

The ultimate goal was to optimize patient safety and provide evidence -based guidance for the appropriate utilization of this medication. Methods: A comprehensive collection and analysis of reports from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database was conducted, encompassing the period from the first quarter of 2015 to the first quarter of 2023. Disproportionality analysis, employing robust algorithms including ROR, PRR, BCPNN, and EBGM was employed for effective data mining to quantify signals associated with lenvatinib-related AEs. Results: Among the collected reports, a total of 15,193 cases were identified where lenvatinib was the ""primary suspected (PS)"" drug, resulting in 50,508 lenvatinib-induced AEs. An analysis was conducted to examine the occurrence of lenvatinib-induced adverse drug reactions (ADRs) across 26 organ systems. The findings revealed the presence of expected ADRs, including diarrhea, vomiting, stomatitis, hepatic encephalopathy, decreased appetite, dehydration, decreased weight, and electrolyte imbalances, which were consistent with the information provided in the drug labels. Furthermore, unexpected significant ADRs were observed at the preferred terms (PT) level, such as interstitial lung disease, pneumothorax, hypophysitis, failure to thrive, polycythemia, hypopituitarism, spontaneous pneumothorax, pulmonary cavitation, and limbic encephalitis. These findings indicated the potential occurrence of adverse effects that are currently not documented in the drug instructions. Conclusions: This study has successfully detected novel and unforeseen signals pertaining to ADRs associated with the administration of lenvatinib, thereby contributing significant insights into the intricate correlation between ADRs and the utilization of lenvatinib.

However, concerns about rare and fatal adverse events, including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) have arisen. The aim of this study was to excavate and evaluate the risk of PARP inhibitors causing MDS and AML based on real-world data from two international pharmacovigilance databases.Methods: We analyzed adverse event (AE) reports of four PARP inhibitors (olaparib, niraparib, rucaparib and talazoparib) associated with MDS and AML from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and EudraVigilance (EV) databases between 1 October 2014, and 30 September 2021, including demographic characteristics, fatality and times to onset. Three different data mining algorithms were used to detect the signals of PARP inhibitors associated with MDS and AML.Results: In total, 16,710 and 11,937 PARP inhibitor AE reports were found in the FAERS and EV databases, of which 332 and 349 were associated with MDS and AML, respectively. The median latencies of MDS and AML associated with PARP inhibitors were 211 [interquartile range (IQR) 93.5-491.25] days and 355 (IQR 72.00-483.50) days, respectively. The average fatality rates of MDS and AML caused by the four PARP inhibitors were 37.96 and 60.41%, respectively, in the FAERS database, while those in the EV database were 5.83 and 12.16%, respectively. Based on the criteria used for the three algorithms, a significant disproportionate association was found between PARP inhibitors as a drug class and MDS/AML. Notably, the risk of MDS was much higher than that of AML. Olaparib appeared to have a stronger association with MDS and AML than did other PARP inhibitors.Conclusion: In the real world, PARP inhibitors increase the risk of MDS and AML, which can result in high mortality and tend to occur during long-term use. Our findings provide objective evidence for the postmarketing safety of PARP inhibitors.","2022","2025-09-23 17:08:13","2025-09-23 17:08:13","0006-01-01","","","","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","rayyan-281088801","","","","","/home/carolina/Zotero/storage/69V7QGXG/Zhao et al. - 2022 - Myelodysplastic SyndromeAcute Myeloid Leukemia Following the Use of Poly-ADP Ribose Polymerase (PAR.pdf","","pharmacovigilance; acute myeloid leukemia; DISEASE; DOUBLE-BLIND; myelodysplastic syndrome; METAANALYSIS; MAINTENANCE THERAPY; OLAPARIB; OVARIAN-CANCER; PARP inhibitors; real-world","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The AE of GIP induced by novel antineoplastic agents has attracted attention recently. We aimed to explore the AE signals of GIP related to novel antineoplastic agents comprehensively based on the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).Methods: The FAERS database containing 71 quarters of records was used for analysis. Reporting odds ratio (ROR), information component (IC), and empirical Bayesian geometric mean (EBGM) were utilized to evaluate the signals of GIP associated with novel antineoplastic drugs. Standardization of drug names was by employing MedEx-UIMA software and Python. Data analysis and visualization were performed using MySQL Workbench and R software.Results: After cleaning and handling the data, 5226 GIP cases were identified that were associated with new antineoplastic medications, where these agents were the main suspected contributors. A total of 37 novel antineoplastic drugs were detected with signals of GIP for ROR and IC. Only 22 drugs showed statistically significant signals for EBGM. We found the GIP signals of 22 novel antineoplastic drugs overlapped for the 3 indicators, including anti-vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, anti-endothelial growth factor receptor, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and so on.Conclusion: The potential risk of GIP associated with several novel antineoplastic agents was identified through data mining, which provided valuable information on the safety risks associated with GIP among these drugs.

However, the traditional model-free disproportionality analysis has been challenged by the insufficiency in investigating subgroup and confounders. These issues result in significant low-precision and biases in data mining for SAER. Methods: The Model-Driven Reporting Odds Ratio (MD-ROR) was proposed to bridge the gap between SAER database and explainable models for exploring individual and confounding effects. MD-ROR is grounded in a well-designed model, rather than a 2 × 2 cross table, for estimating AE-drug signals. Consequently, individual and confounding effects can be parameterized based on these models. We employed simulation data and the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. Result: The simulated data indicated the subgroup effects estimated by MD-ROR were unbiased and efficient. Moreover, the adjusted-MD-ROR demonstrated greater robustness against confounding biases than the crude ROR. Applying our method to the FAERS database suggested higher occurrences of drug interactions and cardiac adverse events induced by Midazolam in females compared to males. Conclusion: The study underscored that MD-ROR holds promise as a method for investigating individual and confounding effects in SAER databases. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2024","2025-09-23 17:08:13","2025-09-23 17:08:13","","1173-1181","","9","23","","Expert Opin.

The current study was to assess olaparib-related adverse events (AEs) of real-world through data mining of the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Methods: Disproportionality analyses, including the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) and the multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS) algorithms were employed to quantify the signals of olaparib-associated AEs. Results: Out of 8,450,009 reports collected from the FAERS database, 6402 reports of olaparib-associated AEs were identified. A total of 118 significant disproportionality preferred terms (PTs) conforming to the four algorithms simultaneously were retained. The most common AEs included anemia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, decreased appetite, blood creatinine increased and dermatomyositis, which were corresponding to those reported in the specification and clinical trials. Unexpected significant AEs as interstitial lung disease, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, folate deficiency, renal impairment and intestinal obstruction might also occur. The median onset time of olaparib-related AEs was 61 days (interquartile range [IQR] 14–182 days), and most of the cases occurred within the first 1 month after olaparib initiation. Conclusion: Results of our study were consistent with clinical observations, and we also found potential new and unexpected AEs signals for olaparib, suggesting prospective clinical studies were needed to confirm these results and illustrate their relationship. Our results could provide valuable evidence for further safety studies of olaparib.","2022","2025-09-23 17:08:13","2025-09-23 17:08:13","","789-802","","","14","","Clin.

Methods: Event reports from the first quarter of 2009 to the third quarter of 2023 were collected and analyzed. Detailed examinations of gender, age, reporter identity, and other aspects were conducted to reveal the fundamental characteristics of Asenapine-related adverse events. Signal mining techniques were employed to systematically evaluate various adverse reactions associated with Asenapine. Results: The study found that adverse event reports involving Asenapine were more common among female patients, with the age group mainly distributed between 18 and 45 years. Physicians were the primary reporters of adverse events, and psychiatric disorders, neurological disorders, and gastrointestinal disorders were the most common areas affected by adverse reactions. In addition to known adverse reactions, potential risks not mentioned in the drug label were identified, such as anosognosia, attentional drift, and psychogenic compensation disorder. Conclusion: Asenapine carries the risk of various adverse reactions alongside its therapeutic effects. In clinical practice, physicians should closely monitor the occurrence of neurological disorders, psychiatric disorders, and gastrointestinal system disorders. © The Author(s) 2024.","2024","2025-09-23 17:08:13","2025-09-23 17:08:13","","","","1","25","","BMC Pharmacol.

However, the majority of current data comes from pre-marketing, with limited real-world studies. Our research aimed to explore post-marketing data of avapritinib. We evaluated the signals of avapritinib-related neuropsychiatric AEs by data mining using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information component (IC) were employed to quantify the signals from the first quarter of 2020 through the fourth quarter of 2023. Subsequently, stratified analyses were conducted to further explore the effect of different stratification schemes on the association between avapritinib and neuropsychiatric AEs. Finally, a combination medication analysis was conducted to explore the impact of the co-administration of neuropsychiatric AEs. A total of 2029 neuropsychiatric AEs were reported, and 49 signals were detected, of which 5 were determined to be new signals. Avapritinib was significantly associated with the occurrence of neuropsychiatric AEs (ROR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.44–1.61; IC: 0.43, IC025: 0.35). The stratified analysis found that gender, age and eight preferred terms (PTs), including cerebral haemorrhage, may affect the severity of AEs. Combination medication analysis showed that combining avapritinib with 19 other medications, including prochlorperazine, may increase the risk of neuropsychiatric AEs. The median time-to-onset (TTO) of avapritinib-related neuropsychiatric AEs was 32 (interquartile range [IQR] 2-200) days, with about 65% of cases occurring within the first three months of treatment. An increase in the signal for neuropsychiatric AEs was identified in post-marketing studies of avapritinib. Clinicians are advised to remain vigilant for such events, particularly during the initial stages of treatment with avapritinib. © The Author(s) 2025.","2025","2025-09-23 17:08:13","2025-09-23 17:08:13","","","","1","15","","Sci.

An indepth systematic analysis of opioid-related adverse events (AEs) can clarify the risks presented by opioid exposure, as well as the individual risk profiles of specific opioid drugs and the potential relationships among the opioids. In this study, 92 opioids were identified from the list of all Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, annotated by RxNorm and were classified into 13 opioid groups: buprenorphine, codeine, dihydrocodeine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, meperidine, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, tapentadol, and tramadol. A total of 14,970,399 AE reports were retrieved and downloaded from the FDA Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS) from 2004, Quarter 1 to 2020, Quarter 3. After data processing, Empirical Bayes Geometric Mean (EBGM) was then applied which identified 3317 pairs of potential risk signals within the 13 opioid groups. Based on these potential safety signals, a comparative analysis was pursued to provide a global overview of opioid-related AEs for all 13 groups of FDA-approved prescription opioids. The top 10 most reported AEs for each opioid class were then presented. Both network analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis were conducted to further explore the relationship between opioids. Results from the network analysis revealed a close association among fentanyl, oxycodone, hydrocodone, and hydromorphone, which shared more than 22 AEs. In addition, much less commonly reported AEs were shared among dihydrocodeine, meperidine, oxymorphone, and tapentadol. On the contrary, the hierarchical clustering analysis further categorized the 13 opioid classes into two groups by comparing the full profiles of presence/absence of AEs. The results of network analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis were not only consistent and cross-validated each other but also provided a better and deeper understanding of the associations and relationships between the 13 opioid groups with respect to their adverse effect profiles. © 2023 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.","2023","2025-09-23 17:08:13","2025-09-23 17:08:13","","1944-1951","","21","248","","Exp.

Previous studies on ocular adverse reactions of antipsychotics were mainly focused on typical antipsychotics. Systematic research on atypical antipsychotics remains limited. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the potential risks of different atypical antipsychotics causing ocular side effects by mining the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. Methods: Extract reports from the FAERS from the first quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2022 were obtained. Data mining of eye disorders associated with atypical antipsychotics was carried out using The Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) method and The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) method to determine positive signals. Results: FAERS reports for 9913783 cases were included in these 28 quarters. 64 defined ocular adverse events were classified into 10 categories according to High-Level Group Terms (HLGT). Conclusions: There were differences in the types and severity of ocular-related adverse events associated with atypical antipsychotics. Ocular neuromuscular-related adverse events were found among all 11 atypical antipsychotics. Olanzapine had the highest signal intensity in oculogyric crisis. Aripiprazole had the highest signal strength in blepharospasm. Cariprazine was associated with cataract-related ocular adverse reactions. In terms of the types of adverse events, our study found that aripiprazole was associated with 28 types of ocular adverse events, followed by quetiapine. Clozapine was only associated with two types of ocular adverse events. Copyright © 2024 Mu and Chen.","2024","2025-09-23 17:08:13","2025-09-23 17:08:13","","","","","15","","Front.

In vitro studies have shown that BPs induce cytotoxicity, inhibit wound healing, and thus affect periodontal disease. Denosumab and BPs have alternative indications. BP and denosumab are not known to correlate with gingival disorders. We assessed such a relationship by applying Bayesian and nonproportional analyses to data in the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. The study analyzed BPs and denosumab-reported incidents with preferred terms found in the narrow Standardized MedDRA Queries for gingival disorders. A total of 5863 reported cases of gingival disorders were associated with five BPs (alendronate, pamidronate, ibandronate, risedronate, and zoledronate) and denosumab. More than 15% of patients with gingival disorders related to BPs and denosumab other than denosumab were hospitalized over short- or long-term periods. Our findings indicated BPs and denosumab had significant reporting odds ratios (ROR), proportional reporting ratios (PRR), and information components (IC) with respect to gingival disorders. Pamidronate had the highest association (ROR = 64.58, PRR = 57.99, IC = 5.71), while the weakest association was found with denosumab (ROR = 3.61, PRR = 3.60, IC = 1.77). Significant associations were found between the six drugs and gingival pain, gingival recession, gingivitis, periodontal disease, and periodontitis. In conclusion, our comprehensive overview of the correlations, clinical characteristics, and prognoses of BPs and denosumab-related gingival disorders suggests that these issues deserve continued surveillance and appropriate management.

Pantoprazole, the most commonly over-utilized Over The Counter (OTC) medication, was selected to assess any short-term or long-term AEs. The study aimed to analyze the novel adverse events of pantoprazole using the FAERS database. Materials and methods: A retrospective case/non-case disproportionality analysis was performed in the FAERS database. This study was based on AEs reported to FAERS from 2006Q1-2021Q3. Openvigil 2.1 was used for data extraction. Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), and Information Component (IC) were applied to measure the disproportionality in reporting. A value of ROR-1.96SE > 1, PRR ≥ 2, and IC-2SD > 0 were considered as the threshold for a positive signal. Results: A total of 1050 reports of dyspepsia, 7248 reports of hypocalcemia and 995 reports of hyponatremia were identified. A potential positive signal for dyspepsia (ROR-1.96SE = 2.231, PRR = 2.359, IC-2SD = 1.13), hypocalcemia (4.961, 5.45, 2.23) and hyponatremia (3.948, 4.179, 1.92) were identified for pantoprazole. Conclusion: Data mining in the FAERS database produced three potential signals associated with pantoprazole.

Methods: Adverse event reports related to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from the first quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2023 were extracted, and the reported Odds ratio methods (ROR method) and comprehensive standard methods (MHRA methods) were used for data mining and analysis. Results: A total of 5,322 reports (accounts for 6.68% of the total reports)of AEs in endocrine system were collected, including 1852 of pabolizumab (34.80%), 2,326 of navuliumab (43.71%), 54 of cimipriliumab (1.01%), 800 of atilizumab (15.03%), 222 of duvariumab (4.17%) and 68 of averumab (1.28%). Endocrine system-related AEs were mainly present in men (excluding those treated with pembrolizumab) aged ≥65 years. The ratio of AEs components in the endocrine system for the six drugs was approximately 3–8%. The main endocrine glands involved in AEs were the thyroid (pembrolizumab), pituitary and adrenal (nivolumab), adrenal (cemiplimab, atezolizumab, and avelumab), and thyroid (durvalumab). Most patients experienced AEs between 30 and 365 (mean, 117) days,the median time was 61d. AEs resulted in prolonged hospitalization in >40% and death in >10% of cases after administration of pembrolizumab, nivolumab, or durvalumab. Conclusion: Men aged ≥65 years should be concerned about endocrine-related AEs. There was a lengthy interval between the use of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and endocrine system-related AEs, but the outcome was serious. Special attention should be given to endocrine system-related AEs when using pembrolizumab, nivolumab, or durvalumab.

Methods: The adverse events report data of oxaliplatin from the first quarter of 2019 (1 January 2019) to the third quarter of 2023 (30 September 2023) were extracted from FAERS database, and the adverse events signal intensity was determined using the reporting odds ratio, proportional reporting ratio, information component, and empirical Bayes geometric mean methods. Time-to-onset and univariate logistic regression analysis were performed to describe the characteristics and risk factors of oxaliplatin-associated neurological adverse events. Results: A total of 4,471 cases of oxaliplatin-associated neurological adverse events were identified, with 318 neurological adverse events being documented, among which 87 adverse events satisfied the thresholds of four methodologies. The median time-to-onset of oxaliplatin-associated neurological adverse events was 2 days (interquartile range 0–36 days). Among the factors significantly influencing oxaliplatin-related neurological adverse events, male sex and combination medication decreased the risk of neurological adverse events, while higher cumulative dose increased the risk. Conclusion: The real-world neurotoxicity spectrum of oxaliplatin and its characteristics and influencing factors were obtained through data mining of FAERS, providing valuable insights for healthcare professionals to effectively manage the risk of neurological adverse events associated with oxaliplatin in clinical practice.

However, the long-term safety of mesalazine in large sample population was unknown. The current study was to assess mesalazine -related adverse events of real-world through data mining of the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Methods: Disproportionality analyses, including the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network and the multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS) algorithms were employed to quantify the signals of mesalazine -associated AEs. Results: Out of 14,149,980 reports collected from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database, 24,284 reports of mesalazine -associated AEs were identified. A total of 170 significant disproportionality preferred terms conforming to the four algorithms simultaneously were retained. The most common AEs included colitis ulcerative, diarrhoea, condition aggravated, crohn’s disease, fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea, haematochezia, which were corresponding to those reported in the specification and clinical trials. Unexpected significant AEs as dizziness, drug ineffective, drug hypersensitivity, infection, off label use, weight decreased, decreased appetite, arthralgia, rash might also occur. The median onset time of mesalazine -related AEs was 1,127 days (interquartile range [IQR] 1,127–1,674 days), and most of the cases occurred 2 years later (n = 610, 70.93%) and within the first 1 month (n = 89, 10.35%) after mesalazine initiation. Conclusion: Results of our study were consistent with clinical observations. We also found potential new and unexpected AEs signals for mesalazine, suggesting prospective clinical studies were needed to confirm these results and illustrate their relationship. Our results could provide valuable evidence for further safety studies of mesalazine.

Observational studies suggested increasing risk of kidney injury in patients with PPIs treatment. We gathered six PPI regimens and adverse reports of acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) based on US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database from 2004 to 2019. We employed reporting odds ratio (ROR) to detect signals. Finally, we identified 3187 PPIs-associated AKI cases and 3457 PPIs-associated CKD cases. We detected significant signals between PPIs and AKI as well as CKD. The signal strength was stronger for CKD (ROR = 8.80, 95% CI 8.49–9.13) than AKI (ROR = 3.95, 95% CI 3.81–4.10), while dexlansoprazole performed stronger association for CKD (ROR = 34.94, 95% CI 30.89–39.53) and AKI (ROR = 8.18, 95% CI 7.04–9.51) than the other five PPIs. The median time from PPIs use to event occurrence was 23 days for AKI and 177 days for CKD. PPIs-associated AKI resulted larger proportion of death, life-threatening, hospitalization and disability events than PPIs-associated CKD. By mining the FAERS big data, we provided more information between PPIs use and the AKI and CKD events. PPIs rational use should be repeatedly stressed. © 2021, The Author(s).","2021","2025-09-23 17:08:12","2025-09-23 17:08:12","","","","1","11","","Sci.

However, chronic use is associated with different adverse effects like anxiety, euphoria, nervousness, insomnia, depression, and agitation. In this study, we assessed the outcome behind the restriction on dispensing Tramadol in private health sectors in Iraq. Methods: We look at tramadol data from VigiBase data searches and the Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSR) that are formally supported by the WHO worldwide database. All complaints were evaluated using Vigilyze data mining and computing IC25 to assess the strength of the link between Tramadol and the adverse reactions it causes, as well as to compare them to other records from around the world. Results: For patients who used tramadol in a variety of dose forms, 184 instances were gathered over the course of seven years by the Iraqi Pharmacovigilance Center. There were 32 cases of hyperhidrosis, which occurred when tramadol was used alone, 47 incidents of vomiting, and 67 cases of nausea. Many adverse effects, including chest pain, hyperhidrosis, headache, dyspnea, and constipation, are more common in Iraqi records than in internationally known instances. Other side effects, such as vomiting, hallucination, vertigo, respiratory depression, and chills, were found to be milder than previously reported. There were no deaths in any of the instances that were recorded during this time period. Conclusion: The number of reported tramadol-induced adverse events has fallen significantly, which can be attributed to the ministry of health restricting tramadol dispensing and enabling public hospitals to only dispense it under medical monitoring. © 2022 The Author(s).","2022","2025-09-23 17:08:12","2025-09-23 17:08:12","","28-31","","","2","","AlRafidain.

Methods: According to the FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), from January 2004 to July 2021, the data of suspected SJS after the use of vancomycin and linezolid were analyzed by imbalance and Bayesian analysis. The onset time, fatality rate and hospitalization rate of vancomycin-associated SJS and linezolid-associated SJS were also investigated. Results: 276 cases of vancomycin-related SJS reports and 63 cases of linezolid-related SJS reports were identified. These two drugs are more common in middle-aged patients (45–64 years) than other age groups, and less common in underage children (<18). Among them, linezolid-related SJS is more common in middle-aged and elderly patients (45–74 years old) than other groups. Except for unspecified data, in vancomycin-associated SJS cases, there are more men than women (49.28% vs 43.84%), while in linezolid-associated SJS cases, the proportion of men and women is almost equal (44.44%). From the point of view of the areas where adverse reactions were reported, about 1/2 of the reports on Vancomycin-related SJS came from North America, and 1/3 of the reports came from Europe. The median onset time of Linezolid-related SJS was 5 days (interquartile range [IQR] 2–7.75), which was significantly earlier than that of Vancomycin-related SJS (12 days, IQR 4–20) (Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.0001). There were no significant differences in mortality and hospitalization rates after vancomycin and linezolid caused SJS. Conclusion: The analysis of faers data provides a comprehensive overview of the adverse reactions of SJS caused by the use of vancomycin and linezolid, and can warn clinical workers to timely intervene and continuously monitor the patients at risk of SJS when using such drugs.

Emerging case reports have raised awareness of cutaneous toxicities, which may be a potentially fatal complication. Objective: To assess the potential relevance between EV and cutaneous toxicities reports through data mining of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adverse event reporting system (FAERS). Methods: Data from January 1, 2019, to November 4, 2021, in the FAERS database were retrieved. Information component (IC) and reporting odds ratio (ROR) were used to evaluate the association between EV and cutaneous toxicities events. Results: EV was significantly associated with cutaneous toxicities in the database compared with both all other drugs (ROR 12.90 [10.62–15.66], IC 2.76 [2.52–3.01], middle signal) and platinum-based therapy (ROR 15.11 [12.43–18.37], IC 2.91 [2.66–3.15], middle signal) in the FAERS database. A significant association was detected between EV and all the cutaneous adverse effects (AEs) except erythema, palmar–plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, and dermatitis allergic. Both Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis occurred 15 times as frequently for EV compared with all other drugs (ROR = 15.20; ROR = 15.52), while Stevens–Johnson syndrome occurred 18 times and toxic epidermal necrolysis occurred 7 times as frequently for EV compared with platinum-based therapy in the database (ROR = 18.74; ROR = 7.80). All groups that limited the gender and age showed a significant association between EV and cutaneous toxicities. Conclusions: A significant signal was detected between EV use and cutaneous toxicities. It is worth noting that Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis were significantly associated with EV use.

We aimed to identify and characterize fracture-related adverse events that are associated with SGLT2is. Materials and Methods: In this observational, retrospective, pharmacovigilance, real-world study, we used disproportionality and Bayesian analyses to compare fracture-related adverse event reporting in patients who received SGLT2is from the first quarter in 2004 to the fourth quarter in 2019 in the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System. We also compared the effect on combined therapy with SGLT2is and other glucose-lowering medications (GLMs), and compared their onset times and outcomes. Results: A total of 317 SGLT2is-associated fractures were identified. Affected patients tended to be aged >45 years (68.76%) and were more often male than female (58.04% vs 34.07%). SGLT2is-associated fracture is most commonly reported with canagliflozin (51.10%), dapagliflozin (24.60%) and empagliflozin (23.66%). SGLT2is or SGLT2is combined with GLMs do not show an association with fracture risk under disproportionality and Bayesian analyses. SGLT2i-associated fractures result in hospitalization in 66.64% of patients and death in 9.38% of patients. GLMs show an increased hospitalization rate compared with SGLT2is (69.72% vs 55.14%, P < 0.0001) and GLMs plus SGLT2is (69.72% vs 61.20%, P = 0.0197). Conclusions: Based on the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database, no association is noted between fracture risk and SGLT2is, or SGLT2is combined with GLMs. Long-term follow up and high-quality studies need to further verify and explore the relationship between SGLT2is and fractures. © 2020 The Authors.

We assessed the ability of pharmacological target adverse-event (TAE) profiles to predict AEs on US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug labels at least 4 years after approval. TAE profiles were generated by aggregating AEs from the FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS) reports and the FDA drug labels for drugs that hit a common target. A genetic algorithm (GA) was used to choose the adverse event (AE) case count (N), disproportionality score in FAERS (proportional reporting ratio (PRR)), and percent of comparator drug labels with an AE to maximize F-measure. With FAERS data alone, precision, recall, and specificity were 0.57, 0.78, and 0.61, respectively. After including FDA drug label data, precision, recall, and specificity improved to 0.67, 0.81, and 0.71, respectively. Eighteen of 23 (78%) postmarket label changes were identified correctly.

This targeted, α‐particle‐emitting therapy has demonstrated significant survival benefit accompanied by a favorable safety profile. Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that its combined use with abiraterone and prednisone/prednisolone may be associated with increased risk of death and fractures. While the precise pathophysiologic mechanisms of these events are not yet clear, collecting evidence from more clinical trials and translational studies is necessary. The aim of our present study is to assess whether accessible sources of patient outcome data can help gain additional clinical insights to radium‐223 dichlorideʹs safety profile. Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of cases extracted from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System and characterized side effect occurrence by using reporting ratios. Results: A total of ~1500 prostate cancer patients treated with radium‐223 dichloride was identified, and side effects reported with the use of radium‐223 dichloride alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents were extracted. Our analysis demonstrates that radium‐ 223 dichloride may often come with hematological‐related reactions, and that, when administered together with other drugs, its safety profile may differ. Conclusions: While more prospective studies are needed to fully characterize the toxicological profile of radium‐223 dichloride, the present work constitutes perhaps the first effort to examine its safety when administered alone and in combination with other agents based on computational evidence from public real‐world post marketing data. © 2019 by the authors.

The objective of the study was to investigate reports of acute kidney injury (AKI) events associated with the concomitant use of oral acyclovir or valacyclovir with an NSAID by using the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) database between January 2004 and June 2012. The frequency of AKI events in patients while simultaneously taking either acyclovir or valacyclovir and an NSAID was compared using the Chi-square test. The effect of concomitant use of acyclovir or valacyclovir and individual NSAIDs on AKI was analyzed by the reporting odds ratio (ROR). The results showed that AKI was reported as the adverse event in 8.6% of the 10923 patients taking valacyclovir compared with 8.7% of the 2556 patients taking acyclovir (p=NS). However, AKI was significantly more frequently reported in patients simultaneously taking valacyclovir and an NSAID (19.4%) than in patients simultaneously taking acyclovir and an NSAID (10.5%) (p<0.01). The results also suggested that increased risk of AKI was likely associated with the concomitant use of valacyclovir and some NSAIDs such as loxoprofen, diclofenac, etodolac, ketorolac, piroxicam or lornoxicam. The case series from the AERS indicated that compared with acyclovir, valacyclovir is more likely to be affected by NSAIDs, and the concomitant use of valacyclovir with some NSAIDs might be associated with increased risk of AKI. The drug interactions with this specific combination of medications are worth exploring further. © 2018 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.","2018","2025-09-23 17:08:12","2025-09-23 17:08:12","","158-162","","2","41","","Biol.

We examined whether case‐only analyses from spontaneous reporting systems can detect host‐medication interactions in oral antidiabetic drug‐associated myocardial infarction. Methods and Results Interaction between sex and use of oral antidiabetic drugs was mined among patients with myocardial infarction in the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System from 2004 to 2014, including 55 718 males and 42 428 females. The odds ratio (OR) of multiplicative interactions was used to estimate sex‐drug interaction. Detected signs of these interactions were then validated by a nested case‐control study utilizing a healthcare record database, Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, from 2001 to 2014, including 31 585 cases and 126 340 controls. In the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System, a higher proportion of male than female patients used metformin (10.32% in males versus 7.82% in females) and sulfonylureas (4.75% in males versus 3.43% in females); after adjusting for patients’ pharmacy‐based chronic disease score, males had a higher risk of metformin‐associated (OR=1.07; 99% confidence interval, 1.00–1.14) and sulfonylureas‐associated (OR=1.21; 99% confidence interval, 1.10–1.33) myocardial infarction than females. Detected signs of sex‐drug interactions were validated in the National Health Insurance Research Database (OR for metformin=1.14; 99% confidence interval, 1.03–1.26; OR for sulfonylureas=1.13; 99% confidence interval, 1.02–1.25). Conclusions Males have a higher risk of metformin‐ and sulfonylureas‐associated myocardial infarction than females, which suggests that sex‐drug interactions are a key issue in diabetes mellitus treatment plan development. This case‐only approach using information from spontaneous reporting systems may be a potential tool for screening host‐medication interactions that cause adverse events. © 2018 The Authors.","2018","2025-09-23 17:08:11","2025-09-23 17:08:11","","","","22","7","","J.

Unnecessary use of antibiotics is particularly concerning because antibiotics may be associated with a number of adverse drug events. Aim: The study was designed to detect the association between pulmonary embolism and antibiotics by disproportionality analysis in the Food and Drug Administration database of Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) using data mining algorithms (DMAs). Materials and Methods: A retrospective case/noncase disproportionality analysis was performed in the FAERS database. This study was based on adverse events (AEs) reported to FAERS from 2004 Q1 to 2022 Q3. Reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), and information component (IC) were applied to measure the disproportionality in reporting. A positive signal of increased AE risk was defined as ROR >1, Chi-square >4, PRR R2 with the number of cases >3, and IC >0. Results: Total AEs in the FAERS database from 2004 Q1 to 2022 Q3 were found to be 26,555,430. Among which 80,809 reports of pulmonary embolism were considered. The same were selected for further analysis which showed that 11 antibiotics were reported for pulmonary embolism. The number of reports for minocycline, chloramphenicol, and moxifloxacin was found to be 113, 14, and 179. A significant potential signal was noted for minocycline (ROR – 2.87, Chi-square – 135.95, IC – 1.22), chloramphenicol (ROR – 3.35, Chi-square – 22.80, IC – 0.77), and moxifloxacin (ROR – 2.08, Chi-square – 99.37, IC – 0.83). Conclusion: This study found a statistically significant increased risk of reporting pulmonary embolism with minocycline, chloramphenicol, and moxifloxacin, although a causal relation cannot be definitively established. © 2024 Perspectives in Clinical Research.","2025","2025-09-23 17:08:11","2025-09-23 17:08:11","","44-49","","1","16","","Perspect.

Using Proportional Reporting Ratios, we identified signals that were further investigated with the literature to evaluate mechanistic hypotheses formed from the integrated FAERS data. Analysis revealed common pharmacological targets perturbed in both SGA and SS cases, indicating that SGAs may induce SS.

Methods: All cases of anxiolytic-induced TdP (n = 260) between 1990 and 2020 were retrieved from the FAERS database using the Preferred Term ‘Torsade de Pointes, code: 10044066’ from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA version 22). Four data-mining algorithms were used for disproportionality analysis: Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Empirical Bayes Geometric Mean (EBGM), and Information Content (IC). Anxiolytics with ≥3 TdP cases were included. Results: Of a total of eight drugs, this study identified seven signals of TdP, of which six signals were new, namely for alprazolam, bromazepam, lorazepam, meprobamate, midazolam, and oxazepam. Based on disproportionality analysis, among new signals, the highest risk of TdP was observed with bromazepam and midazolam. Alprazolam showed the lowest risk for TdP, while diazepam did not reach significant disproportionality.

Dupilumab, the first biologic approved for atopic dermatitis, showed excellent effects on improving pruritus and sleep after only two weeks of treatment but, in some cases, may have paradoxical effects. The rate of sleep-related side-effects remains unknown. More specifically, adverse-drug reactions (ADRs) related to dupilumab have been investigated during the safety phase of randomized clinical trials or in small retrospective epidemiological surveys, but little is known about sleep-related ADRs in real-life settings. Therefore, we took advantage of a global largescale pharmacovigilance database, carrying out a comprehensive data mining analysis to look at different sleep-related ADRs reported among patients under anti IL-4/13 therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed individual case study reports (ICSRs) in VigiBaseTM, the World Health Organization (WHO) global pharmacovigilance database of ADRs collected by national drug authorities in > 140 countries (> 90% of the world population). We looked for patterns of potentially sleep-related ADRs and we applied a disproportionality analysis based on Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN). A meta-analytical approach was used to synthesize the overall effect size of sleep-related ADRs potentially associated to Dupilumab administration. RESULTS: From inception up to March 9, 2021, 94,065 ADRs from 37,848 unique reports were included and analyzed in the present paper: 1,294 of them (1.4%) concerned sleep disturbances (n=27). Most of sleep-related complaints were generic sleep disorders (n=630), followed by insomnia (n=312), somnolence (n=81), lethargy (n=60), night sweats (n=30), middle insomnia (n=39), hypersomnia (n=25), poor-quality sleep (n=21), initial insomnia (n=17), sleep apnea syndrome (n=13), nightmares (n=11) and sleep deficit (n=11). Interestingly, restlessness and restless leg syndrome, nocturnal dyspnea, narcolepsy and bruxism were reported in 7, 6, 5, 4 and 3 cases, respectively. Only sleep deficit [OR 15.67 (95% CrI 8.61-28.51); IC 3.24 (95% CrI 2.26-3.97)], generic sleep disorder [OR 6.22 (95% CrI 5.74-6.73); IC 2.60 (95% CrI 2.48-2.71)], nocturnal dyspnea [OR 3.68 (95% CrI 1.53-8.87); IC 1.56 (95% CrI 0.03-2.56)] and middle insomnia [OR 1.87 (95% CrI 1.36-2.56); IC 0.88 (95% CrI 0.39-1.30)] achieved the statistical significance threshold. CONCLUSIONS: In this work, we identified over 37,000 unique case-reports of Dupilumab side-effects reported on the WHO pharmacovigilance database. We specifically categorized those related to sleep issues, which were 1,294. Our findings from large numbers of cases provide data supporting the clinical observations that Dupilumab is usually effective in improving sleep quality and sleep disturbances/ impairments, given the lack of statistical significance of several sleep-related ADRs. Further work is needed to closely scrutinize the impact of Dupilumab on sleep, in terms of underlying mechanisms, and to better understand residual sleep disorders in patients with atopic dermatitis and other allergic diseases treated with Dupilumab. Thus, sleep monitoring may be helpful for dermatologists in managing atopic dermatitis patients treated with dupilumab. The limitations of spontaneous reporting systems including underreporting and reporting bias, heterogeneity of sources and impossibility to infer any causal relationship merit consideration and further research is needed.","2022","2025-09-23 17:08:11","2025-09-23 17:08:11","","4074-4081","","11","26","","Eur.

To fill some gaps in the understanding and elucidate potential biological mechanisms of action frequently associated with MCAEs, we present a unique workflow linking observational population data with the available knowledge at molecular, cellular, and psychopharmacology levels. It is based on statistical analysis of pharmacovigilance reports and subsequent signaling pathway analyses, followed by evidence-based expert manual curation of the outcomes. Our analysis: (a) ranked pharmaceuticals with high occurrence of such adverse events (AEs), based on disproportionality analysis of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, and (b) identified 120 associated genes and common pathway nodes possibly underlying MCAEs. Nearly two-thirds of the identified genes were related to immune modulation, which supports the critical involvement of immune cells and their responses in the regulation of the central nervous system function. This finding also means that pharmaceuticals with a negligible central nervous system exposure may induce MCAEs through dysregulation of the peripheral immune system. Knowledge gained through this workflow unravels putative hallmark biological targets and mediators of drug-induced mood and cognitive disorders that need to be further assessed and validated in experimental models. Thereafter, they can be used to substantially improve in silico/in vitro/in vivo tools for predicting these adversities at a preclinical stage.","2020","2025-09-23 17:08:11","2025-09-23 17:08:11","","2829-2845","","8","94","","Arch.

There has been continued debate about this topic. Therefore, we present a detailed analysis of data from individual case safety reports of pioglitazone use (PG-ICSRs) associated with bladder cancer reported worldwide and in India. Methods: Data from PG-ICSRs reported by the National Coordination Centre's Pharmacovigilance Programme of India, as well as over 131 World Health Organization member countries in the Uppsala Monitoring Centre's VigiLyze pharmacovigilance database system, from January 1, 1967, to March 4, 2018, were collected. Comparisons between data from global and Indian PG-ICSRs were made by applying filters such as country, bladder cancer, age group, gender, time period, information component, and data mining. Findings: Among the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported with pioglitazone use worldwide, bladder cancer and related terms were the most highly reported (43%). The most frequently co-reported concurrently used drug was metformin, which was included in 25% and 40% of overall and bladder cancer–specific PG-ICSRs, respectively. Suspected bladder cancer–specific pioglitazone-related reactions were reported in 27 countries, with 8548 serious and 1858 fatal cases and an information components value of 9.15. The Americas had the highest relative percentage of suspected bladder cancer in PG-ICSRs (53%), while the prevalence was much lower in India (2%). In both cohorts, men over the age of 45 years constituted the most highly reported population. Implications: India has a very low prevalence of reported overall and bladder cancer–specific pioglitazone-related ADRs compared to Europe and the Americas. Possible explanations for the difference in reporting rates include variance in genetic makeup, low BC risk factor, pioglitazone prescription at a lower therapeutic dose, greater use of chemopreventive spices in the diet, higher frequency of metformin as a concurrent drug, and under-reporting of ADRs.","2019","2025-09-23 17:08:11","2025-09-23 17:08:11","","2252-2262","","11","41","","Clin.

The study aims to investigate whether drug exposure could contribute to MS, by analyzing worldwide spontaneous reporting archives of adverse drug reaction (ADRs). Research design and methods: We retrieved information from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) over a 13-year period. Reporting odds ratio (ROR) for MS was calculated for each single substance. Disproportionality signals were considered when at least 10 cases were retrieved with a lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) >1. Results: After a customized data-mining process, 3,226 reports of MS were retrieved. ‘Antineoplastic and immunomodulating drugs’ (33% of total reports) were the most frequently reported, with 10 disproportionality signals, including etanercept (445 cases; ROR: 2.48; 95% Cl: 2.24–2.74), adalimumab (329; 2.05; 1.83–2.30), and infliximab (119; 2.25; 1.87–2.70). We also observed signals for drugs acting on hormone balance, bone density, and central nervous system. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that immunomodulatory drugs increase the risk of MS and point out that some other drug classes should be further investigated for this risk.","2018","2025-09-23 17:08:11","2025-09-23 17:08:11","","869-874","","9","17","","Expert Opin.

We aimed to analyze the characteristics of drug associated anaphylaxis, and to compare the differences among different drugs. Methods: A disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis were used in data mining to identify suspected anaphylaxis associated with AIT, omalizumab, and dupilumab based on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from January 2004 to March 2021. Demographic information, time interval to onset, and death rates of AIT, omalizumab, and dupilumab associated anaphylaxis were also analyzed. Results: Totally 9,969 anaphylactic events were identified. Reports of AIT, omalizumab, and dupilumab associated anaphylactic events were 64, 7,784, and 2,121, respectively. AIT had a high reporting odds ratio (ROR) of 5.03 [95%confidental interval (CI) 3.69–6.85], followed by omalizumab (ROR 2.24, 95% CI 2.18–2.29), and dupilumab had a negative signal for anaphylaxis. In children, most anaphylactic reactions (68%) were reported in the 12–17-year-old group. More reports of anaphylaxis related to AIT were in boys (73%), while more reports of anaphylaxis related to omalizumab (63%) and dupilumab (58%) were in girls. Most symptoms occurred on the day of drug initiation. The death rate of AIT related anaphylaxis was the lowest (0%), the death rate of omalizumab was 0.87%, while the death rate of dupilumab was 4.76%. No significant differences were observed among these drugs. Conclusion: AIT and omalizumab had a positive signal for anaphylaxis, while dupilumab had a negative signal for anaphylaxis. Patients should be strictly monitored after administration of AIT and also biologics. It also gives us a suggestion for choosing a combined biologics with AIT when the risk of anaphylaxis was considered. © Copyright © 2021 Bian, Zhang, Li, Wang, Cui, Xu, Guan, Zhao and Chen.","2021","2025-09-23 17:08:11","2025-09-23 17:08:11","","","","","12","","Front.

Several studies evaluated SGLT2 inhibitor-related acute kidney injury (AKI), but pharmacoepidemiology studies are needed to compare the adverse events in different SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). Methods: We used disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis in data mining to screen the AKI cases after initiating different SGLT2i among diabetic patients, based on the FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) updated to December 2020. We also investigated the onset time and fatality rates of SGLT2i-associated AKI, which was based on preferred terms (PTs) coded for the renal adverse events in the structure of the FARES database. Results: We identified 2483 cases of AKI following SGLT2i regimens among diabetic patients. Most of them were 45–64 years old (58.46%) and > 65 years old (28.67%). Canagliflozin generated the largest number of AKI reports (n = 1650, 66.45%) in our study. Canagliflozin showed the strongest association among SGLT2i, evidenced by the highest reporting odds ratio (ROR = 3.70, two-sided 95% CI 3.51–3.91), proportional reporting ratio (PRR = 3.39, χ2 = 2635.06), and empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM = 3.18, one-sided 95% CI 3.04). The median onset time to AKI was 72.0 (interquartile range [IQR] 21.0–266.0) days after SGLT2i initiation. The general hospitalization rate of SGLT2i-associated AKI was 63.50%, and the fatality rate was 1.59%. The deceased patients (62.94 ± 10.69 years) were significantly older than the survived ones (57.82 ± 11.84 years) (P = 0.011). Conclusion: We compared AKI events in the real-world practice of various SGLT2i among diabetic cases from the FAERS database. It is essential to monitor kidney function during the early administration of SGLT2i.

However, it remains unclear whether age is a risk factor for immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Materials and methods: To analyze the association between irAEs and age based on data from the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database between January 2004 and December 2020, we performed a case/noncase study on ICI-related adverse events. Cases were defined as adverse event cases with ICI therapy and irAEs, and noncases were defined as adverse event cases with ICI therapy and without irAEs. One case was matched to a noncase using the sex, reporter, report year, and type of ICI regimen. The reporting odds ratios (RORs) were used to assess the disproportionality of irAEs between older adults (≥65 years) and younger adults (<65 years). Results: The study shows that compared with younger adults, the ROR of older adults was 1.12 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08–1.16) and 1.18 (95% CI: 1.14–1.23) before and after matching, respectively. The signal of age-related irAEs was detected in patients treated with ICI monotherapy but not in patients treated with combination therapy. Further analysis revealed a spectrum of age-related toxicities including cardiovascular toxicities, lung toxicities, musculoskeletal toxicities, nervous system toxicities, renal toxicities, and skin toxicities.

Methods: Disproportionality and Bayesian analysis were used in data mining to screen the suspected renal adverse effects after the administration of different ICIs, based on FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from January 2004 to September 2019. The time to onset, fatality and hospitalization rates of renal adverse effects were also investigated. Results: We identified 1444 reports of renal adverse effects. Affected patients tended to be older than 65 years (52.7%). Renal effects were most commonly reported in nivolumab monotherapy (33.24%). Atezolizumab appeared the strongest association among six ICI monotherapies, based on the highest reporting odds ratio (ROR = 144.38, two-sided 95% CI = 123.08 −169.37), proportional reporting ratio (PRR = 139.13, χ2 = 21 425.38), and empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM = 131.75, one-sided 95% CI = 115.28). The combination treatments showed higher RORs, PRRs, and EBGMs, compared with either nivolumab or pembrolizumab monotherapy. The median onset time of renal adverse effects was 48 (interquartile range [IQR] 18.75-121.25) days after the monotherapies of ICI regimens. Patients treated with the combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab were younger than receivers in nivolumab monotherapy (63.81 ± 12.03 vs 66.39 ± 11.53, P =.004); The fatality rate of renal adverse effects appeared lower in the combination group, compared to nivolumab monotherapy (18.53% vs 27.50%, P =.004). The top hospitalization rates due to renal effects occurred in patients with combination therapies. Conclusion: Based on the FAERS database, we profiled renal adverse effects after various ICIs with real-world data in occurrences, clinical characteristics, and prognosis. Renal effects should be tightly monitored, especially within the first several months after ICIs administration. Particular concern should be paid for patients with a tendency for kidney impairments, such as old age. © 2020 The Authors.

Pharmacovigilance risk signal detection is innovative and has been applied to the safety monitoring and reevaluation of drugs post-marketing. Aim: The study aimed to promote safe daptomycin prescribing by mining and evaluating the daptomycin ADR signals from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Method: A disproportionality analysis (reporting odds ratio ROR and proportional reporting ratio PRR) was utilized for FAERS data mining from the first quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2021 (the most recent quarterly data at the time of the study). Preferred Terms of ADR reports were categorized by System Organ Class (SOC) based on the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Results: This study retrieved 12,221 cases within the reporting period. A total of 140 repetitive signals were obtained by ROR and PRR, of which 53 new ADR signals were not recorded in the drug labels/datasheets. The top three ADR reports were “blood creatine phosphokinase elevation” (ROR, 56.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 51.07–62.87, PRR 51.94), “eosinophilic pneumonia” (ROR 696.71, 95%CI 603.21–804.70, PRR 657.57), and “rhabdomyolysis” (ROR 22.85, 95%CI 19.94–26.18, PRR 21.83). The highest ROR of “antimicrobial susceptibility test resistant” was found at 9808.14. Reports of rare adverse events, such as “necrotizing fasciitis and compartment syndrome,” have emerged. The significant SOCs were “Infections and Infestations” and “Investigations.” Conclusion: New daptomycin ADR signals were detected. Clinicians should monitor these potential ADRs in patients receiving daptomycin.","2022","2025-09-23 17:08:10","2025-09-23 17:08:10","","1351-1360","","6","44","","Int. J. Clin.

This study aimed to assess the safety of cyclosporine through the analysis of adverse events (AEs) related to cyclosporine in the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). To detect AEs associated with cyclosporine, a pharmacovigilance analysis was conducted using four algorithms on the FAERS database: reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), and empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM). A statistical analysis was performed on data extracted from the FAERS database, covering 19,582 case reports spanning from 2013 to 2022. Among these cases, 3,911 AEs were identified, with 476 linked to cyclosporine as the primary suspected drug. Cyclosporin-induced AEs targeted 27 System Organ Classes (SOCs). Notably, the highest case at the SOC level included eye disorders, injury, poisoning, and procedural complications, as well as immune system disorders, all of which are listed on the cyclosporine label. Furthermore, we discovered novel potential AEs associated with hepatobiliary disorders, among others. Moreover, unexpected adverse drug reactions (ADRs), such as biliary anastomosis complication and spermatozoa progressive motility decrease, were identified. Importantly, these newly identified ADRs were not mentioned on the cyclosporine label, which were involved in injury, poisoning, and procedural complications, and investigations at the SOC level.

However, limited information is available regarding its real-world adverse reactions. Therefore, this study aimed to assess and evaluate etoposide-related adverse events in a real-world setting by using data mining method on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database.Methods: Through the analysis of 16,134,686 reports in the FAERS database, a total of 9,892 reports of etoposide-related adverse drug events (ADEs) were identified. To determine the significance of these ADEs, various disproportionality analysis algorithms were applied, including the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), and the multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS) algorithms.Results: As a result, 478 significant disproportionality preferred terms (PTs) that were identified by all four algorithms were retained. These PTs included commonly reported adverse events such as thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, anemia, stomatitis, and pneumonitis, which align with those documented in the drug's instructions and previous clinical trials. However, our analysis also uncovered unexpected and significant ADEs, including thrombotic microangiopathy, ototoxicity, second primary malignancy, nephropathy toxic, and ovarian failure. Furthermore, we examined the time-to-onset (TTO) of these ADEs using the Weibull distribution test and found that the median TTO for etoposide-associated ADEs was 10 days (interquartile range [IQR] 2-32 days). The majority of cases occurred within the first month (73.8%) after etoposide administration. Additionally, our analysis revealed specific high-risk signals for males, such as pneumonia and cardiac infarction, while females showed signals for drug resistance and ototoxicity.Discussion: These findings provide valuable insight into the occurrence of ADEs following etoposide initiation, which can potentially support clinical monitoring and risk identification efforts.","2023","2025-09-23 17:08:10","2025-09-23 17:08:10","0010-01-01","","","","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","rayyan-281088771","","","","","/home/carolina/Zotero/storage/QJS9XKC4/Cui et al. - 2023 - A pharmacovigilance study of etoposide in the FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS) database, w.pdf","","pharmacovigilance; FAERS; DRUG-REACTIONS; adverse drug event; etoposide; DISPROPORTIONALITY ANALYSIS; CELL-LUNG-CANCER; COLONY-STIMULATING FACTORS; FEBRILE NEUTROPENIA; PHASE-II TRIAL; PRIMARY PROPHYLAXIS; PUBLIC VERSION; real-word analysis; TOPOISOMERASE-II; TUMOR LYSIS SYNDROME","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, few epidemiological studies have investigated the risk, clinical features, and outcomes of AKI caused by different GLP-1RA. In this study, Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) data were used to compare the association between different GLP-1RA and AKI in the real world. Methods: FAERS data from January 2004 to December 2021 were mined using disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis to determine the correlation between different GLP-1RA and AKI, and the onset time, mortality, and hospitalization rate of different GLP-1RA were analyzed. Results: We identified 2670 cases of AKI events associated with GLP-1RA, of which liraglutide was the most commonly reported (34.98%). The patients with AKI were mainly males (47.94%), and the age group was mainly 45-84 years old (73.15%). obese patients with weight more than 99kg (24.42%) were more likely to have AKI. According to different signal mining methods, reporting odds ratio (ROR) (1.50, 95% confidence interval =1.41-1.60) and Bayesian confidence Propagation neural network (0.57, 95% confidence interval =0.54), liraglutide was more strongly associated with AKI than other GLP-1RA. The median time to onset of AKI was 63 days [quartile range (IQR): 15-458.5 days]. In addition, the hospitalization rate and fatality rate of patients with GLP-1RA-related AKI were 45.28% and 4.23% respectively. Conclusions: Based on the data in the FAERS database, we analyzed the risk, onset time, and adverse reaction outcomes of GLP-1RA-induced AKI in detail. The results showed that liraglutide had the highest risk of AKI. From the early stage of treatment, we need to monitor patients’ renal function regularly, especially for patients with high kidney risks such as obesity and age.

Ripretinib, the first tyrosine kinase switch control inhibitor, has not yet been extensively studied for long-term safety in large populations. This study evaluates Ripretinib-related adverse events (AEs) in real-world applications by analyzing data from the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).Methods To quantify signals of AEs, we employed several disproportionality analyses: the Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), and Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS).Results In the FAERS database, out of 7,064,646 reports, 3,161 were identified as related to Ripretinib AEs, with 438 significant disproportionality in preferred terms. The most common adverse reactions were tiredness, hair loss, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, loss of appetite, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, and vomiting. These reactions align with the medication instructions and reports from corresponding clinical trials. Notably, the label includes unexpected and significant AEs such as ""hepatic neoplasm"", ""hair texture abnormal"", ""metastases to liver"" and ""red blood cell count decreased"". The median onset time for Ripretinib-related AEs was 99 days, with an interquartile range of 27-245 days. Most cases (26.74%, n = 165) occurred within the first month of Ripretinib administration.Conclusion Our findings align with clinical observations. We identified novel and unexpected AEs signatures of Ripretinib, indicating that prospective clinical studies are necessary to confirm these findings and clarify their implications.

Methods: Disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis were utilized for data mining of the suspected adverse events of myocarditis after ICIs use based on the Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from January 2004 to June 2018. The times to onset and fatality rates of myocarditis following different ICI regimens were also compared. Results: A total of 315 reports of myocarditis adverse events were identified with ICIs. Among 6 ICI monotherapies, avelumab had the highest association with myocarditis based on the highest reporting odds ratio (ROR = 42.65, 95% two-sided CI = 15.86–114.72), proportional reporting ratio (PRR = 42.61, χ2 = 159.63) and empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM = 41.87, 95% one-sided CI = 15.57). The combination therapies of ipilimumab plus pembrolizumab or nivolumab had higher RORs, PRRs and EBGMs than did pembrolizumab or nivolumab monotherapy. Myocarditis associated with the ipilimumab plus nivolumab treatment appeared to have earlier onset (16.5 [IQR 14–29.75] days vs 32 [IQR 16–77] days, p<0.01) and higher fatality rate (65.75% vs 50.40%, p<0.05) than that associated with nivolumab monotherapy. Conclusions: Analysis of FAERS data provides more precise profile on the occurrences and characteristics of myocarditis after different ICI regimens. The findings support continued surveillance, risk factor identification, and comparative studies.","2019","2025-09-23 17:08:10","2025-09-23 17:08:10","","","","","76","","Int.

However, it remains uncertain whether statin therapy is associated with cancer risk. To examine the association between statin use and the risk of cancer, we conducted data mining using the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and a large organized database of claims constructed by a database vendor (The Japan Medical Data Center Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan [JMDC]). Methods: Relevant reports in the FAERS, which included data from the first quarter of 2004 through the end of 2012, were identified and analyzed. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) was used to detect spontaneous report signals and was calculated using the case/non-case method. Additionally, signals were detected via the information component (IC) using the IC025 metric. Furthermore, event sequence symmetry analysis (ESSA) was applied to identify the risk of cancer following treatment with statins over the period January 2005 to July 2013. Results: In the FAERS database analyses, significant signals for colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer were found for statins as a class. In the ESSA, significant associations between statin use and colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer were found, with adjusted sequence ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 1.20 (1.08-1.34) and 1.31 (1.13-1.53), respectively, at an interval of 48 months. Conclusions: Multi-methodological approaches using different algorithms and databases suggest that statin use is associated with an increased risk for colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer. © 2015 Ivyspring International Publisher.","2015","2025-09-23 17:08:10","2025-09-23 17:08:10","","223-233","","3","12","","Int.

Liver function test elevations were observed in a greater proportion of patients receiving ETI compared with placebo; however, the relatively small number of patients and short duration of study preclude detection of rare but clinically significant associations with drug-induced liver injury (DILI). To address this gap, we assessed the real-world risk of DILI associated with ETI through data mining of the FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS). Methods: Disproportionality analyses were conducted on FAERS data from the fourth quarter of 2019 through the third quarter of 2022. Comparative patient demographics, onset time and outcomes for ETI-DILI were also obtained. Results: 452 reports of DILI associated with ETI were found, representing 2.1 % of all adverse event reports for ETI. All disproportionality measures were significant for ETI-DILI at p < 0.05; the reporting odds ratio (ROR) (2.82) was comparable to that of drugs classified by FDA as “Most-DILI concern”. The most notable demographic finding was a male majority (5:4 male to female ratio) for ETI-DILI compared to a female majority (4:5 male to female ratio) for non ETI-DILI. Median ETI-DILI onset time was 50.5 days, and hospitalization was the second most common complication. Conclusion: Using FAERS data, ETI was found to be disproportionately associated with DILI. Future research is needed to investigate the hepatotoxic mechanisms and assess potential mitigation strategies for ETI-induced hepatotoxicity.","2024","2025-09-23 17:08:10","2025-09-23 17:08:10","","566-572","","3","23","","J.

The aim of this study was to explore and systematically analyze the potential link between five PPIs and the rhabdomyolysis events using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. Methods: Suspected rhabdomyolysis events associated with PPIs were identified by data mining with the reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the information component (IC), and Empirical Bayes Geometric Mean (EBGM). Demographic information, drug administration, and outcomes of PPI-induced rhabdomyolysis events were also analyzed. Results: There were 3311 reports associated with PPI-induced rhabdomyolysis that were identified. After removing duplicates, 1899 cases were determined to contain complete patient demographic data. The average age was 65 ± 18 year and 57% were male. Omeprazole and pantoprazole had the same largest percentage of reports. Lansoprazole had the highest ROR index of 12.67, followed by esomeprazole (11.18), omeprazole (10.27), rabeprazole (10.06), and pantoprazole (9.24). PRR, IC, and EBGM showed similar patterns. This suggested that lansoprazole exhibited the strongest correlation with rhabdomyolysis. In rhabdomyolysis events, PPIs were mainly “concomitant” (>60%), and only a few cases were “primary suspects” (<15%). Rabeprazole showed the lowest death rate while lansoprazole showed the highest. Conclusions: The study suggested that significant rhabdomyolysis signals were associated with PPIs. Further research should be performed in drug safety evaluation for a more comprehensive association.","2024","2025-09-23 17:08:10","2025-09-23 17:08:10","","289-296","","2","39","","J. Gastroenterol.

Objective: This study aimed to assess the toxicity profiles of three anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies (dinutuximab, dinutuximab β, and naxitamab) in clinical applications by mining and evaluating the adverse drug reaction (ADR) signals from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System. Methods: Data in the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System from the time anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies became available in the market to the first quarter of 2023 were searched. The signals of anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody-associated ADRs were quantified using four types of algorithms, including the reporting odds ratio, the proportional reporting ratio, the combination of the proportional reporting ratio and χ2 statistic method used by the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, and the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network. The ADRs were categorized by System Organ Class based on the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, and were sorted according to the frequency and signal strength of ADRs. Results: A total of 370 adverse drug event reports with anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies listed as the ‘primary suspected drugs’ were identified, with 116 ADR signals detected, of which 22 were not in the drug labels. Among the adverse drug event reports, 276 reports concerned dinutuximab/dinutuximab β as primary suspected drugs with 90 ADR signals, involving 19 System Organ Classes, of which 21 signals were not in the label; 94 adverse drug event reports concerned naxitamab as the primary suspected drug with 26 ADR signals, involving 11 System Organ Classes, of which one was not in the label. For dinutuximab/dinutuximab β-related ADRs, the top five most frequent were “fever”, “abdominal pain”, “elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST)”, “elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT)” and “hypotension”; the top five most intensive signals were “hypoalbuminemia”, “elevated AST”, “capillary leakage syndrome”, “hypoxia” and “elevated ALT”. For naxitamab-related ADRs, the top five most frequent were “hypotension”, “pain”, “urticarial”, “hypertension” and “rash”; the top five most intensive signals were “hypotension”, “urticaria”, “hypoxemia”, “bronchospasm” and “hypertension”. Involved System Organ Classes included “investigations” and “respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders” containing the most types of ADR signals in dinutuximab/dintuximab β-related ADRs and naxitamab-related ADRs, respectively. Conclusions: Our study comprehensively analyzed the toxicity profiles of anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies and provides an important reference for clinical monitoring and ADR identification of these drugs.","2024","2025-09-23 17:08:10","2025-09-23 17:08:10","","175-185","","2","26","","Pediatr.

However, its adverse events (AEs) have not been investigated in real-world settings. Aim: This study aimed to detect and evaluate AEs associated with teprotumumab in the real-world setting by conducting a pharmacovigilance analysis of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. Method: Reporting odds ratio (ROR) was used to detect risk signals from the data from January 2020 to March 2023 in the FAERS database. Results: A total of 3,707,269 cases were retrieved, of which 1542 were related to teprotumumab. The FAERS analysis identified 99 teprotumumab-related AE signals in 14 System Organ Classes (SOCs). The most frequent AEs were muscle spasms (n = 287), fatigue (n = 174), blood glucose increase (n = 121), alopecia (n = 120), nausea (n = 118), hyperacusis (n = 117), and headache (n = 117). The AEs with strongest signal strengths were autophony (ROR = 14,475.49), deafness permanent (ROR = 1853.35), gingival recession (ROR = 190.74), deafness neurosensory (ROR = 129.89), nail growth abnormal (ROR = 103.67), onychoclasis (ROR = 73.58), ear discomfort (ROR = 72.88), and deafness bilateral (ROR = 62.46). Eleven positive AE signals were found at the standardized MedDRA queries (SMQs) level, of which the top five SMQs were hyperglycemia/new-onset diabetes mellitus, hearing impairment, gastrointestinal nonspecific symptoms and therapeutic procedures, noninfectious diarrhea, and hypertension. Age significantly increased the risk of hearing impairment. Conclusion: This study identified potential new and unexpected AE signals of teprotumumab. Our findings emphasize the importance of pharmacovigilance analysis in the real world to identify and manage AEs effectively, ultimately improving patient safety during teprotumumab treatment.","2024","2025-09-23 17:08:10","2025-09-23 17:08:10","","471-479","","2","46","","Int.

Safety data for these medicines are based on controlled clinical trials and case reports, limiting the knowledge about less frequent, rare or unique population adverse events excluded from clinical trials. Objective: This study aims at analyzing the reports of Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) related to these two medicines, focusing on events in pregnant women and foetuses. Methods: Data from the open-access FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from 2020 to 2022 were used to create a dashboard on the Grafana platform to ease querying and analyzing report events. Potential safety signals were generated using the ROR disproportionality measure. Results: Remdesivir was notified as the primary suspect in 7,147 reports and tocilizumab in 19,602. Three hundred and three potential safety signals were identified for remdesivir, of which six were related to pregnant women and foetuses (including abortion and foetal deaths). Tocilizumab accumulated 578 potential safety signals, and three of them were associated with this population (including neonatal death). Discussion: None of the possible signals generated for this population were found in the product labels. According to the NIH and the WHO protocols, both medicines are recommended for pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19. Conclusion: Despite the known limitations of working with open data from spontaneous reporting systems (e.g., absence of certain clinical data, underreporting, a tendency to report severe events and recent medicines) and disproportionality analysis, the findings suggest concerning associations that need to be confirmed or rejected in subsequent clinical studies.","2024","2025-09-23 17:08:07","2025-09-23 17:08:07","","","","","15","","Front.

The presented study aimed to evaluate the Everolimus-associated adverse events (AEs) through data mining of the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Methods: The AE records were selected by searching the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database from the first quarter of 2009 to the first quarter of 2022. Potential adverse event signals were mined using the disproportionality analysis, including reporting odds ratio the proportional reporting ratio the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network and the empirical Bayes geometric mean and MedDRA was used to systematically classify the results. Results: A total of 24,575 AE reports of Everolimus were obtained using data from the FAERS database, and Everolimus-induced AEs occurrence targeted 24 system organ classes after conforming to the four algorithms simultaneously. The common significant SOCs were identified, included benign, malignant and unspecified neoplasms, reproductive system and breast disorders, etc. The significant AEs were then mapped to preferred terms such as stomatitis, pneumonitis and impaired insulin secretion, which have emerged in the study usually reported in patients with Everolimus. Of note, unexpected significant AEs, including biliary ischaemia, angiofibroma, and tuberous sclerosis complex were uncovered in the label. Conclusion: This study provided novel insights into the monitoring, surveillance, and management of adverse drug reaction associated with Everolimus. The outcome of serious adverse events and the corresponding detection signals, as well as the unexpected significant adverse events signals are worthy of attention in order to improving clinical medication safety during treatment of Everolimus.","2024","2025-09-23 17:08:07","2025-09-23 17:08:07","","","","","15","","Front.

Moreover, potential toxicological mechanisms of CDK4/6is-related liver injury were explored via drug–gene network analysis. Methods: In this retrospective observational study, we collected reports of DILI associated with CDK4/6i use from the FAERS dated January 2014 to March 2023. We conducted disproportionality analyses using the reporting odds ratio (ROR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Pathway enrichment analysis and drug-gene network analyses were subsequently performed to determine the potential mechanisms underlying CDK4/6i-induced liver injury. Results: We found positive signals for DILI with ribociclib (ROR = 2.60) and abemaciclib (ROR = 2.37). DILIs associated with liver-related investigations, signs, and symptoms were confirmed in all three reports of CDK4/6is. Moreover, ascites was identified as an unlisted hepatic adverse effect of palbociclib. We isolated 189 interactive target genes linking CDK4/6 inhibitors to hepatic injury. Several key genes, such as STAT3, HSP90AA1, and EP300, were revealed via protein-protein analysis, emphasizing their central roles within the network. KEGG pathway enrichment of these genes highlighted multiple pathways. Conclusion: Our study revealed variations in hepatobiliary toxicity among the different CDK4/6 inhibitors, with ribociclib showing the highest risk of liver injury, followed by abemaciclib, while palbociclib appeared relatively safe. Our findings emphasize the need for cautious use of CDK4/6 inhibitors, and regular liver function monitoring is recommended for long-term CDK4/6 inhibitor use.","2024","2025-09-23 17:08:07","2025-09-23 17:08:07","","","","","15","","Front.

Methods: We used proportional imbalance analysis to evaluate the correlation between ICS/INCs and infection events. The data was extracted from the FAERS database from April 2015 to September 2023. Further analysis was conducted on the clinical characteristics, site of infection, and pathogenic bacteria of ICS and INCs infection adverse events (AEs). We used bubble charts to display their top 5 infection adverse events. Results: We analyzed 21,837 reports of infection AEs related to ICS and INCs, with an average age of 62.12 years. Among them, 61.14% of infection reports were related to females. One-third of infections reported to occur in the lower respiratory tract with Fluticasone, Budesonide, Ciclesonidec, and Mometasone; over 40% of infections reported by Triamcinolone Acetonide were eye infections; the rate of oral infections caused by Beclomethasone were 7.39%. The reported rates of fungal and viral infections caused by beclomethasone were 21.15% and 19.2%, respectively. The mycobacterial infections caused by Budesonide and Ciclesonidec account for 3.29% and 2.03%, respectively. Bubble plots showed that the ICS group had more fungal infections, oral infections, pneumonia, tracheitis, etc. The INCs group had more eye symptoms, rhinitis, sinusitis, nasopharyngitis, etc. Conclusion: Women who use ICS and INCs are more prone to infection events. Compared to Budesonide, Fluticasone seemed to have a higher risk of pneumonia and oral candidiasis. Mometasone might lead to more upper respiratory tract infections. The risk of oral infection was higher with Beclomethasone. Beclomethasone causes more fungal and viral infections, while Ciclesonide and Budesonide are more susceptible to mycobacterial infections.","2024","2025-09-23 17:08:07","2025-09-23 17:08:07","","1457-1469","","","19","","Int.

Previous research described the potential risks of Kampo formula-linked pseudoaldosteronism. However, few studies assessed the risk factors using a real-world database and a data-mining approach. Using the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database, we extracted pseudoaldosteronism reports for 148 Kampo formulas covered by Japanese national health insurance. Adverse events were decided according to the preferred terminology of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities/Japanese version 25.1. We calculated reporting odds ratio (RORs) and identified Kampo formulas as suspected causes of pseudoaldosteronism. Moreover, we evaluated clinical factors associated with Kampo formula-induced pseudoaldosteronism via logistic regression. From April 2004 to November 2022, 6334 adverse events related to the Kampo formulas were reported. We selected 2471 reports containing complete clinical data, including 210 reports on pseudoaldosteronism. In the pseudoaldosteronism group, 69.0% of patients were female, and 85.2% were ≥70 years old. The formulas most commonly associated with pseudoaldosteronism were Shakuyakukanzoto, Yokukansan, and Ryokeijutsukanto (ROR [95% confidence interval {CI}] = 18.3 [13.0–25.9], 8.1 [5.4–12.0], and 5.5 [1.4–21.9], respectively). Logistic analysis identified female sex (odds ratio [OR] [95% CI] = 1.7 [1.2–2.6]; P = 0.006), older age (≥70, 5.0 [3.2–7.8]; P < 0.001), low body weight (<50 kg, 2.2 [1.5–3.2]; P < 0.001), diuretics usage (2.1 [1.3–4.8]; P = 0.004), hypertension (1.6 [1.1–2.4]; P = 0.014), and dementia (7.0 [4.2–11.6]; P < 0.001) as pseudoaldosteronism-related factors. Additionally, the daily Glycyrrhiza dose (OR = 2.1 [1.9–2.3]; P < 0.001) and duration of administration (>14 days, OR = 2.8 [1.7–4.5]; P < 0.001) were associated with adverse events. We did not observe an interaction between aging and hypertension.

Moreover, novel potential adverse events emerge, including oral diseases, fractures occurring in various locations, and signals indicating tumors beyond the drug's approved indications. Conclusions: This study highlights the significance of closely monitoring patients for potential adverse events during denosumab treatment. Healthcare professionals should exercise heightened vigilance for the development of oral diseases, fractures, and tumors in individuals receiving denosumab therapy. The identification of these additional ADE signals should inform clinical decision-making, patient risk assessments, and ongoing efforts in pharmacovigilance, thereby ensuring the safe and effective utilization of denosumab.","2024","2025-09-23 17:08:06","2025-09-23 17:08:06","","1220-1230","","4","28","","J.

However, recent case reports have indicated new evidence regarding their association with acute kidney injury (AKI), with some patients experiencing acute tubular injury after PCSK9 inhibitors use. Objectives: To clarify the relationship between PCSK9 inhibitors and AKI, we conducted a pharmacovigilance study. Methods: Using the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database from the third quarter of 2015 to the fourth quarter of 2022, a disproportionality analysis was employed to identify adverse events suggestive of AKI after PCSK9 inhibitors use. The drugs of interest included evolocumab and alirocumab. Results: A total of 144,341 adverse event reports related to PCSK9 inhibitors were analyzed, among which 444 cases were suspected of AKI for evolocumab, and 172 cases for alirocumab. Evolocumab had a greater impact on AKI in males (ROR 1.4, 95% CI 1.54–1.69). The ROR and 95% CI for evolocumab and Alirocumab were 0.13 (0.12–0.14) and 0.26 (0.23–0.30) respectively. Further analysis of AKI associated with the concomitant use of PCSK9 inhibitors with cephalosporins, furosemide, torsemide, pantoprazole, omeprazole, and esomeprazole revealed ROR and 95% CI of 0.38 (0.23–0.62), 0.38 (0.31–0.48), 0.18 (0.08–0.38), 0.23 (0.17–0.29), 0.20 (0.16–0.26), and 0.14 (0.10–0.20) respectively. Conclusion: Through the FAERS database, we analyzed the clinical characteristics of AKI associated with PCSK9 inhibitors, exploring its risks. Our findings suggest that PCSK9 inhibitors might have a potential protective effect against AKI and exhibit similar effects when co-administered with other nephrotoxic drugs.","2024","2025-09-23 17:08:06","2025-09-23 17:08:06","","","","","15","","Front.

The aim of this study was to evaluate sacubitril/valsartan-induced adverse events (AEs) through data mining of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Methods: Reports in the FAERS from the third quarter of 2015 (FDA approval of sacubitril/valsartan) to the fourth quarter of 2023 were collected and analyzed. Disproportionality analyses, including the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), and empirical Bayesian geometric mean (EBGM) algorithms were adopted in data mining to quantify signals of sacubitril/valsartan-associated AEs. Results: A total of 12,001,275 reports of sacubitril/valsartan as the “primary suspected (PS)” and 99,651 AEs induced by sacubitril/valsartan were identified. More males than females reported AEs (59.95% vs. 33.31%), with the highest number of reports in the 60–70 years age group (8.11%), and most AEs occurred < 7 days (14.13%) and ≥ 60 days (10.69%) after dosing. Sacubitril/valsartan-induced AE occurrence targeted 24 system organ classes (SOCs) and 294 preferred terms (PTs). Of these, 4 SOCs were strongly positive for all four algorithms, including cardiac disorders, vascular disorders, ear and labyrinth disorders, and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. Among all PTs, consistent with the specification, hypotension (n = 10,078) had the highest number of reports, and dizziness, cough, peripheral swelling, blood potassium increased, and renal impairment were also reported in high numbers. Notably, this study also discovered a high frequency of side effects such as death, dyspnea, weight change, feeling abnormal, hearing loss, memory impairment, throat clearing, and diabetes mellitus. Conclusion: This study identified potential new AE signals and gained a more general understanding of the safety of sacubitril/valsartan, promoting its rational adoption in the cardiovascular system.","2024","2025-09-23 17:08:06","2025-09-23 17:08:06","","","","","15","","Front.

We aimed to comprehensively and comparatively analyze the risk of ocular toxicity associated with various ADCs using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. Methods: Data were extracted from the FAERS database from Q3 2011 to Q3 2023. We analyzed the clinical characteristics of ADCs-related ocular adverse events (AEs). These data were further mined by proportional analysis and Bayesian approach to detect signals of ADCs-induced ocular AEs. Moreover, the time to onset of ocular toxicity was also evaluated. Results: A total of 1,246 cases of ocular AEs were attributed to ADCs. Ocular toxicity signals were observed in patients treated with belantamab mafodotin, brentuximab vedotin, enfortumab vedotin, mirvetuximab soravtansine, sacituzumab govitecan, trastuzumab deruxtecan, and trastuzumab emtansine. Of these, belantamab mafodotin, trastuzumab emtansine, and mirvetuximab soravtansine, whose payloads are microtubule polymerization inhibitors, were more susceptible to ocular toxicity. The ten most common ADCs-related ocular AEs signals are keratopathy [ROR = 1,273.52, 95% CI (1,129.26–1,436.21)], visual acuity reduced [ROR = 22.83, 95% CI (21.2–24.58)], dry eye [ROR = 9.69, 95% CI (8.81–10.66)], night blindness [ROR = 259.87, 95% CI (228.23–295.89)], vision blurred [ROR = 1.78, 95% CI (1.57–2.02)], photophobia [ROR = 10.45, 95% CI (9.07–12.05)], foreign body sensation in eyes [ROR = 23.35, 95% CI (19.88–27.42)], ocular toxicity [ROR = 144.62, 95% CI (117.3–178.32)], punctate keratitis [ROR = 126.21, 95% CI (101.66–156.69)], eye disorder [ROR = 2.71, 95% CI (2.21–3.32)]. In terms of onset time, sacituzumab govitecan displayed an earlier onset of 21 days, while trastuzumab deruxtecan exhibited the latest onset of 223 days. Conclusion: ADCs may increase the risk of ocular toxicity in cancer patients, leading to serious mortality. With the widespread application of newly launched ADCs, combining the FAERS data with other data sources is crucial for monitoring the ocular toxicity of ADCs. In addition, novel ocular toxicity signals not documented in product labeling were detected. Further research will be necessary to validate our findings in the future.","2024","2025-09-23 17:08:06","2025-09-23 17:08:06","","","","","15","","Front.

Nevertheless, its use in clinical practice has been affected by safety concerns. The work retrospectively investigated adverse events (AEs) of denosumab to better understand toxicities. Methods: The FAERS data base data from Q1 of 2010 to Q3 of 2023 was chosen. The definition of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) was dependent on preferred terms (PTs) and system organ class (SOCs). Following the removal of duplicate reports, a disproportionality analysis was conducted to identify safety signals through the calculation of reporting odds ratios (ROR). Results: During the reporting period, 130611 denosumab-related cases were identified; 670 pTs with a substantial disproportionality were retained. The connective and musculoskeletal tissue disorders, poisoning, injury, and procedural complications, as well as medical and surgical procedures, were among the important SOCs that satisfied the criteria. Reports at PT levels including off-label use, death, osteonecrosis of the jaw, arthralgia, and pain in extremities were determined. Severe consequences in terms of life-threatening injuries and death accounted for 841 and 19704 cases, respectively of the reported cases. Conclusion: These findings underscore the critical importance of pharmacovigilance and are consistent with established clinical observations. Notably, osteonecrosis of the jaw, arthralgia, pain in extremities, back pain, myalgia, and bone pain were identified as the most prevalent risk signals associated with denosumab.","2024","2025-09-23 17:08:06","2025-09-23 17:08:06","","","","","15","","Front.

Prompt identification of high-risk drugs provides a valuable basis for enhancing clinical drug safety. Methods: The adverse event reports related to coagulopathies from Q1 2004 to Q2 2024 were extracted from the ASCII data packages in FAERS. The reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), and Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) were used to identify adverse drug reaction signals associated with coagulopathies. Results: During the reporting period, 40,545 reports were retrieved, with a slightly higher proportion of females than males. Among the top 30 drugs associated with the occurrence of coagulopathies, 24 drugs exhibited positive signals in risk analysis. Based on the individual drug reporting odds ratio (95% confidence interval) as a measure of risk signal strength, the top five drugs are as follows: gemcitabine [ROR (95% CI):16.87 (15.83–17.98)], busulfan [ROR (95% CI):15.51 (13.69–17.58)], anti-thymocyte globulin [ROR (95% CI):15.49 (13.49–17.78)], tacrolimus [ROR (95% CI):12.7 (11.57–13.95)], etonogestrel and ethinylestradiol vaginal ring [ROR (95% CI):11.88 (10.95–12.89)]. After categorizing the drugs, the strongest risk signal is sex hormones and modulators of the genital system [ROR (95% CI):11.88 (10.95–12.89)], followed by analgesics [ROR (95%CI): 6.73 (6.38–7.1)], immunosuppressants [ROR (95% CI):3.91 (3.76–4.05)], antineoplastic agents [ROR (95% CI):3.33 (3.22–3.45)], corticosteroids for systemic use [ROR (95% CI): 2.94 (2.73–3.18)], antiepileptics [ROR (95% CI):1.93 (1.71–2.18)], drugs used in diabetes [ROR (95% CI):1.5 (1.34–1.67)], antibacterials for systemic use [ROR (95% CI):1.46 (1.28–1.68)].

However, real-world data regarding its long-term safety and tolerability in large sample population are incomplete. We evaluated abaloparatide-associated safety signals by data mining of the FDA pharmacovigilance database. Introduction: We investigated 33,480(0.14%) ABL-related adverse events (AEs) through data mining of Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) retrospectively. Methods: Reporting odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), and the multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS) were employed to quantify the signals of ABL-related AEs from 2017Quarter2 to 2022.Serious and non-serious cases were compared by Mann-Whitney U test or Chi-squared (χ 2) test. Results: We collected 8,470,497 reports from the FAERS database, including 11,487 reports defined ABL as the primary suspected (PS) drug. Additionally, 36.16% of the reports were submitted by healthcare professionals (n=4154), compared to 62.26% reported by consumers (n=7140). A total 99 signals simultaneously conforming to four algorithms were detected, among which, 35 signals were identified as unexpected signals. Such as growing pains (n=13), waist circumference increased (n=21), sensory disturbance (n=103), tinnitus (n=65), visual acuity reduced (n=54), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (n=61), and hair growth abnormal (n=13). Patient age (p < 0.001) might be associated with an increased risk of AEs severity. The most common timeframe for AE occurrence was 0–7 days. Conclusion: Our study provided a deeper and broader understanding of abaloparatide’s safety profiles, which would help healthcare professionals to mitigate the risk of AEs in clinical practice, a low number of unexpected AEs supporting ongoing additional pharmacovigilance.","2023","2025-09-23 17:08:05","2025-09-23 17:08:05","","2047-2058","","12","34","","Osteoporosis Int.","","","","","","","","English","","","","rayyan-281079835","","","","","/home/carolina/Zotero/storage/AQTSEFNF/Shi et al. - 2023 - A real-world pharmacovigilance study of abaloparatide based on the FDA Adverse Event Reporting Syste.pdf","","adult; age distribution; aged; article; data mining; female; Food and Drug Administration; human; major clinical study; pharmacovigilance; retrospective study; clinical practice; dizziness; drug safety; abdominal pain; constipation; fatigue; nausea; postmarketing surveillance; side effect; controlled study; observational study; vomiting; body weight gain; factual database; abnormal sensation; arthralgia; contusion; backache; bone pain; headache; insomnia; limb pain; muscle spasm; myalgia; arthropathy; rheumatoid arthritis; injection site bleeding; injection site contusion; injection site erythema; injection site irritation; injection site pain; injection site pruritus; injection site rash; injection site reaction; nail disease; heart arrhythmia; sensory dysfunction; visual acuity; heart palpitation; abaloparatide; alkaline phosphatase; alkaline phosphatase blood level; disease severity; fragility fracture; gastrointestinal discomfort; gingiva disease; gingiva erythema; hair disease; heart rate; hypercalcemia; hyperphosphatemia; impaired fracture healing; injection site discoloration; injection site discomfort; injection site hypersensitivity; injection site urticaria; jaw pain; muscle tightness; neck pain; nervousness; orthostatic hypertension; orthostatic hypotension; osteoporosis; Paget bone disease; pain; paranasal sinus disease; parathyroid disease; parathyroid hormone; pollakisuria; postmenopause osteoporosis; risk benefit analysis; risk reduction; senile osteoporosis; skin tumor; sleep disorder; soft tissue tumor; spinal pain; stomach distension; tinnitus; tooth pain; trichorrhexis; vertigo; visual impairment; waist circumference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the limitations of clinical trials, the association between quetiapine and rare cardiac adverse events (AEs) is still unclear. This study is to evaluate quetiapine-associated cardiac AEs through data mining of FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Methods: Reporting odds ratio (ROR) was used to quantify the signals of quetiapine-related cardiac AEs from the first quarter (Q1) of 2018–2022 Q1. Serious and nonserious cases were compared, and signals were prioritized using a rating scale. Results: A total of 1004 cases of quetiapine-associated cardiac AEs were identified, with 31 signals being detected, among which 13 AEs were identified as new and unexpected signals. Besides, nine and 22 cardiac AEs were identified as moderate and weak clinical priority. The median TTO for moderate and weak clinical priority signals were 0 and 4 days, respectively. All of the cardiac AEs had early failure type characteristics, suggesting that most of the patients developed cardiac AEs in a few days after quetiapine treatment, and that the risk of cardiac AEs occurrence would be gradually decreased over time. Conclusion: Our study provided valuable evidence for health-care professionals to mitigate the risk of quetiapine-associated cardiac AEs based on an extensive analysis of a real-world, large-sample FAERS database, and prioritize cardiac AE signals.","2023","2025-09-23 17:08:05","2025-09-23 17:08:05","","2705-2716","","9","29","","CNS Neurosci.

Large post-marketing databases are still lacking for safety analysis of the new generation of anti-seizure medications. Based on the FDA's adverse event reporting system (FAERS) database, this study aimed to investigate, assess, and offer evidence for the safety of PER to support clinical decision-making. Methods: Perampanel-related adverse reaction signals were mined using the reporting odds ratio (ROR), medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (MHRA), and Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN). The rate and occurrence of reported adverse responses were examined. Results: With the three methodologies used in combination, 83 signals mostly related to psychosis and different nervous system disorders were detected. Among them, suicide behavior, respiratory depression, hepatotoxicity, cognitive impairment, and other possible novel signals warranted consideration. Further examination of the age and gender differences in the detected signals revealed that elderly patients should be closely monitored for any change in consciousness and the occurrence of movement disorders; male patients should be observed for negative mental reactions like a personal attack and homicidal ideation; and female patients should be watched for the occurrence of negative reactions in memory, weight, vision, liver function, and other specific areas. Conclusions: This study found that PER had the risk of causing suicide behavior, respiratory depression, hepatotoxicity, and cognitive impairment among other adverse effects. When used clinically, PER should be closely monitored for the occurrence of adverse effects on mental health and behavior. However, these results should be interpreted with caution.","2023","2025-09-23 17:08:05","2025-09-23 17:08:05","","","","","145","","Epilepsy Behav.","","","","","","","","English","","","","rayyan-281079839","","","","","/home/carolina/Zotero/storage/NEM44SR4/Liu et al. - 2023 - Mining and analysis of adverse drug reactions associated with perampanel based on FAERS database.pdf","","age distribution; article; data mining; human; sex difference; automutilation; depression; dizziness; drug safety; gastrointestinal disease; mental disease; neurologic disease; skin disease; somnolence; altered state of consciousness; brain disease; hallucination; seizure; erectile dysfunction; adverse outcome; delirium; descriptive research; ataxia; liver toxicity; information processing; hyponatremia; motor dysfunction; speech disorder; vertigo; acute psychosis; amnesia; apnea; attention disturbance; balance disorder; behavior disorder; clinical decision making; cognitive defect; coma; confusion; coordination disorder; delusion; diplopia; dose response; dysarthria; dysphoria; epilepsy; evidence based medicine; geriatric patient; hyperammonemia; hypersalivation; mental health; mood disorder; NCT00699582; NCT00699972; NCT00700310; paranoia; perampanel; persecutory delusion; personality disorder; psychosis; reporting and data system; respiration depression; restlessness; suicide; urine retention","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Materials and Methods: We collected data on UTIs and fungal infections related to metformin, SGLT-2 inhibitors, and their combinations from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. We calculated the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to assess the risk associated with these adverse events when using these medications. We evaluated differences in categorical variables using the Chi-squared test. Results: SGLT-2 inhibitors present a higher risk of UTIs and fungal infections compared to metformin. Empagliflozin showed the lowest risk of UTIs (ROR 0.928, 95% CI 0.858–1.005), while dapagliflozin exhibited the lowest risk of fungal infections (ROR 0.874, 95% CI 0.815–0.938). Additionally, patients using SGLT-2 inhibitors alone reported more cases of UTIs and fungal infections than those treated with a combination of SGLT-2 inhibitors and metformin (ROR>1). Conclusion: SGLT-2 inhibitors are associated with an increased risk of UTIs and fungal infections compared to combination therapy with an SGLT-2 inhibitor and metformin. The reduced infection reports with combined SGLT-2 inhibitors and metformin therapy may be due to the potential antimicrobial activity of metformin.","2024","2025-09-23 17:08:05","2025-09-23 17:08:05","","282-289","","3","46","","J.

The current study aimed to quantify the strength of association between the use of different AAPs and SD using real-world data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), as well as investigate the receptor mechanisms that are involved. Methods: Data from the FAERS database from the first quarter of 2004 to the third quarter of 2023 were queried through OpenVigil 2.1. Disproportionality analysis was estimated using the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information component (IC) methods, and linear regression was used to investigate the relationship between ROR and receptor occupancy which was estimated using in vitro receptor binding profiles. Results: Our analysis yielded 4839 reports that co-mentioned AAP and SD events, and the findings revealed statistical associations between 12 AAPs and SD. The highest signal value was identified for iloperidone reporting retrograde ejaculation with iloperidone (ROR = 832.09, ROR025 = 552.77; IC = 9.58, IC025 = 6.36), followed by compulsive sexual behavior with aripiprazole (ROR = 533.02, ROR025 = 435.90; IC = 7.30, IC025 = 5.97), and psychosexual disorder for aripiprazole (ROR = 145.80, ROR025 = 109.57; IC025 = 6.47, IC025 = 4.86). Different characteristics of the SD side effects in each AAPs were discovered after further data mining. Regression analysis revealed potential effects for receptor occupancy of D2, D3, and 5-HT1A receptors on ROR. However, no significant correlation persisted following sensitivity analyses. Conclusion: This is the first study to investigate the AAP-SD associations by using FAERS. In this study, we report for the first time a significant association between aripiprazole and SD based on real-world data. The study suggests that different AAPs have varying levels of association with SD, and the D2, D3, and 5-HT1A receptor occupancy may contribute to potential mechanisms. The findings of this study warrant further validation of more studies and clinical causality assessment.","2024","2025-09-23 17:08:04","2025-09-23 17:08:04","","","","","15","","Front.

Given the inherent constraints of conventional clinical trials, the correlation between BV and cardiac adverse events (AEs) remains enigmatic. The objective of this investigation is to comprehensively assess cardiac AEs attributed to BV by employing advanced data mining techniques, utilizing the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). The indices for the assessment of disproportionality encompass the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio, the information component, and the empirical Bayesian geometric mean. Employing these sophisticated metrics, we gauged the extent of disproportionate occurrences. The dataset was sourced from the FAERS from the first quarter of 2012 to first quarter of 2023, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of the potential correlation between BV and cardiac AEs. This scrutiny encompassed a comparative analysis of both cardiac and non-cardiac AEs. A total of 495 cases of BV’s cardiac AEs were discerned, with the identification of 31 preferred terms (PTs). Among these, 8 PTs emerged as conspicuous signals of cardiac AEs, notably encompassing ventricular hypokinesia (ROR 7.59), tachyarrhythmia (ROR 7.06), sinus tachycardia (ROR 6.18), cardiopulmonary failure (ROR 4.44), pericardial effusion (ROR 4.32), acute coronary syndrome (ROR 4.02), cardiomyopathy (ROR 3.30), and tachycardia (ROR 2.76). The manifestation of severe outcomes demonstrates a discernible correlation with the cardiac AEs (P < 0.001). Our investigation furnishes invaluable insights for healthcare practitioners to proactively mitigate the incidence of BV-associated cardiac AEs.","2024","2025-09-23 17:08:04","2025-09-23 17:08:04","","5253-5264","","7","397","","Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch.

Methods: We extracted adverse event reports of hematological malignancies (HMs) patients with clearly definable SPMs from the FAERS and VigiBase databases (2017–2023). Disproportionality analysis using reporting odds ratio (ROR) and adjusted ROR was performed to assess associations between SPMs and CAR-T therapy. Time-to-onset analysis explored factors affecting SPM manifestation. Findings: SPMs post CAR T-cell therapy include HMs and solid tumors. T-cell lymphoma and myelodysplastic syndromes were consistently identified as positive signals across the overall and subgroup analyses. Hematological SPMs showed earlier onset with increasing annual incidence post CAR-T therapy, whereas solid tumors exhibit delayed manifestation. SPMs in CAR-T recipients had significantly earlier onset than non-recipients. Furthermore, age-specific characteristics reveal earlier SPM manifestations in pediatric, adolescent, and young adult populations compared to older populations post CAR-T therapy. Interpretation: The current SPM profile highlights the necessity of long-term safety monitoring for all CAR-T recipients given the observed yearly increase of SPMs. Customizing long-term SPM screening across different age groups may enhance early detection and intervention strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes in the follow-up of CAR-T recipients.

Methods: This study aimed to identify culprit drugs that reduced male semen quality based on the United States Food and Drug Administration adverse event reporting system. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities preferred terms and standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities queries were used to define reduced male semen quality. Adverse events related to drug-reduced male semen quality were then analyzed by disproportionality analysis using the United States Food and Drug Administration adverse event reporting system data between 2004 and 2023. Results: At the preferred term level, 59 drugs with risk signals were detected to be associated with drug-reduced male semen quality, with the three most frequently reported second-level Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical groups being antineoplastic agents (n = 16, 27.12%), psychoanaleptics (n = 9, 15.25%), and psycholeptics (n = 6, 10.17%). At the standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities queries level, the five drugs with the greatest number of cases were finasteride (845 cases, IC025 = 7.72), dutasteride (163 cases, IC025 = 7.22), tamsulosin (148 cases, IC025= 5.99), testosterone (101 cases, IC025= 4.08), and valproic acid (54 cases, IC025= 2.44). Additionally, clinical information about drug-reduced male semen quality is absent from the Summary of Product Characteristics of 41 drugs in our study.

However, in the real world, there is a lack of relevant reports on adverse reaction data mining for fulvestrant. To perform data mining on adverse events (AEs) associated with fulvestrant and explore the risk factors contributing to severe AEs, providing a reference for the rational use of fulvestrant in clinical practice. Retrieved adverse event report information associated with fulvestrant from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, covering the period from market introduction to September 30, 2023. Suspicious AEs were screened using the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and proportional reporting ratio methods based on disproportionality analysis. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted on severe AEs to explore the risk factors associated with fulvestrant-induced severe AEs. A total of 6947 reports related to AEs associated with fulvestrant were obtained, including 5924 reports of severe AEs and 1023 reports of non-severe AEs. Using the disproportionality analysis method, a total of 210 valid AEs were identified for fulvestrant, with 45 AEs (21.43%) not listed in the product labeling, involving 11 systems and organs. The AEs associated with fulvestrant were sorted by frequency of occurrence, with neutropenia (325 cases) having the highest number of reports. By signal strength, injection site pruritus showed the strongest signal (ROR = 658.43). The results of the logistic regression analysis showed that concurrent use of medications with extremely high protein binding (≥ 98%) is an independent risk factor for severe AEs associated with fulvestrant. Age served as a protective factor for fulvestrant-related AEs. The co-administration of fulvestrant with CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitors did not show statistically significant correlation with the occurrence of severe AEs. Co-administration of drugs with extremely high protein binding (≥ 98%) may increase the risk of severe adverse reactions of fulvestrant. Meanwhile, age (60-74 years) may reduce the risk of severe AEs of fulvestrant. However, further clinical research is still needed to explore and verify whether there is interaction between fulvestrant and drugs with high protein binding through more clinical studies.","2024","2025-09-23 17:08:04","2025-09-23 17:08:04","","11367","","1","14","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","English","","","","rayyan-281079794","","","","","/home/carolina/Zotero/storage/PM3Q5G2S/Yin et al. - 2024 - Adverse event signal mining and serious adverse event influencing factor analysis of fulvestrant bas.pdf","","adolescent; adult; adverse drug reaction; aged; article; child; data mining; automutilation; clinical feature; clinical practice; depression; dizziness; abdominal discomfort; abdominal pain; algorithm; constipation; adverse event; anaphylaxis; controlled study; disseminated intravascular clotting; angioneurotic edema; data extraction; Adolescent; Adult; Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems; Aged; Article; Data Mining; Databases, Factual; adverse drug reactions; Adverse events; adverse outcome; Aged, 80 and over; antipsychotics; asthenia; bile duct carcinoma; CELL LUNG-CANCER; CHEMOTHERAPY; Child; COMBINATION; data analysis; data analysis software; Data mining; delirium; diarrhea; disproportionality analysis; *Data Mining; alogliptin; antineoplastic agent; Antineoplastic Agents; artificial neural network; comparative study; crizotinib; cytochrome P450 3A4; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; adverse events; alopecia; anemia; arthralgia; arthritis; chronic kidney failure; death; dehydration; chill; adverse drug events; back propagation neural network; bone pain; breast cancer; DISPROPORTIONALITY; Bayesian confidence propagation neural network; deep vein thrombosis; coughing; bradycardia; digestive system perforation; disability; congestive heart failure; bipolar disorder; *United States Food and Drug Administration; aggression; amfebutamone; body weight; delusion; albumin-bound paclitaxel; atelectasis; Breast Neoplasms; breast tumor; clonazepam; acute pancreatitis; amyloidosis; BREAST-CANCER; abemaciclib; cyclin dependent kinase 4; cyclin dependent kinase 6; *Databases, Factual; anxiety; bruxism; *Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems/statistics & numerical data; *Fulvestrant/adverse effects; absolute neutrophil count; adverse event profile; Adverse event reporting system; ALK inhibitor; anger; Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal; Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/adverse effects; antineoplastic hormone agonists and antagonists; apathy; bipolar II disorder; bradykinesia; bradyphrenia; Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy; C reactive protein abnormal; catatonia; CDK4/6 inhibitor; CDK6; chronic insomnia; Crizotinib; dalpiciclib; diagnostic procedure; Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 inhibitors; DISORDER; drug abuse","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Medical management of CS is essential for controlling hypercortisolism as part of preoperative preparation for definitive surgical treatment and for managing residual or relapsed hypercortisolism post-surgery. Osilodrostat, a dual inhibitor of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid biosynthetic pathways, has been approved for the medical treatment of CS since early 2020. However, real-world data on its adverse effects remain limited. We mined the FAERS database and analyzed the reports associated with osilodrostat up to 1 October 2024. Methods: Descriptive and disproportionality methods based on Relative Odds Ratio (ROR), Chi-square (χ2), and Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), were used to discern potential safety signals and assess the significance of osilodrostat-associated adverse events. Results: This study identified 782 reports in which osilodrostat was the primary suspected drug, containing 593 preferred terms (PTs) and 2481 occurrences. The most frequently registered events belonged to the following SOCs: “General disorders and administration site conditions” (n = 457, 18.4%), “Injury, poisoning and procedural complications” (n = 311, 12.5%), “Gastrointestinal disorders” (n = 278, 11.2%), “Investigations” (n = 260, 10.5%), and “Nervous system disorders” (n = 184, 7.4%). Among PTs, off-label use was the most commonly reported, aligning with the fact that the vast majority of cases originated from the U.S. (84%), where osilodrostat is officially approved only for the treatment of CD. Disproportionality analysis confirmed previously known and new potential adverse drug reactions associated with osilodrostat treatment, including reports of cardiac flutter (n: 4; PRR: 19.42; χ2: 49.57), ventricular extrasystoles (n: 4; PRR: 11.85; χ2: 29.62), muscular weakness (n: 8; PRR: 2.25; χ2: 4.38), rib fracture (n: 4; PRR: 6.66; χ2: 13.99), spinal fracture (n: 3; PRR: 4.66; χ2: 5.35), sepsis (n: 9; PRR: 2.63; χ2: 7.56), fungal infections (n: 4; PRR: 3.67; χ2: 5.33), and COVID-19 (n: 32; PRR: 5.07; χ2: 101.16). Conclusions: This study highlights new risks and offers valuable insights into osilodrostat use; however, further research and validation are necessary, particularly for adverse reactions not yet explicitly documented in the summary of product characteristics.","2025","2025-09-23 17:08:04","2025-09-23 17:08:04","","","","10","14","","J.

We obtained reports of ICI-associated BP from the first quarter of 2011 to the first quarter of 2024 in the FAERS database. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) method of the disproportionality analysis was performed to assess the potential risk for ICI-associated BP. We also described the clinical characteristics of ICI-associated BP and evaluated the time to onset (TTO) of BP developed after treatment with ICIs. Eight hundred and six cases of ICI-associated BP were gathered, in which 56.58% of the patients were aged 65 years or older. The majority of patients were male, accounting for 68.49% of all cases. The prevalent potential cancer type was skin cancer (31.64%). The results of the disproportionality analysis showed that males (ROR = 2.10 [1.78–2.49]), patients aged 65 or older (ROR = 2.13 [1.79–2.55]), and patients with skin cancer (ROR = 2.08 [1.80–2.43]) were more likely to develop ICI-associated BP. In comparison to cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 inhibitor and programmed cell death ligand 1 inhibitor, programmed cell death 1 inhibitor-associated BP has a higher risk of development (ROR = 24.45 [22.52–26.56]). ICI-associated BP had a median TTO of 204 days (interquartile range 57–426 days). ICI-associated BP is a rare but important immune-related adverse event. Our study provided helpful information to help medical professionals further understand ICI-associated BP.","2025","2025-09-23 17:08:04","2025-09-23 17:08:04","","309-316","","2","52","","J.

The study gathered 14,753,012 reports of AEs, of which 46,726 were related to Vedolizumab. Signal mining identified 401 Preferred Terms (PTs) involving 27 System Organ Classes (SOCs). There was an increasing trend in the number of reports, with a slightly higher proportion of reports from women compared to men, and the primary reporting group was adults, especially those aged between 18 and 65 years. New potential AE signals were identified, such as a higher incidence of Pregnancy, Haematochezia, and Clostridium difficile infection. Although less frequent, strong signals were noted for Incisional hernia, Intestinal fistula infection, Anastomotic complication, Drug metabolising enzyme increased, Gingival graft, Intestinal anastomosis complication, Anorectal infection, Perineal rash, and Abdominal hernia obstructive.

In this work, we investigate a computational approach using data mining tools to detect safety signals from post-market safety databases, or in other words, to identify adverse events (AEs) with disproportionately high reporting rates compared to other AEs, associated with a particular drug or a drug class. Essentially, we view this as a problem of cluster analysis-based anomaly detection on post-market safety data, where the goal is to ‘unsupervisedly’ detect the anomalous or the signal AEs. Our findings demonstrate the potential of using a clustering ensemble method to detect drug safety signals. It employs multiple clustering or anomaly detection algorithms, followed by a performance comparison of the candidate algorithms based on a collection of appropriate measures of goodness of clustering results. The method is general enough to include any number of clustering or anomaly detection algorithms and goodness measures, and performs better than any of the candidate algorithms in identifying the signal AEs. Extensive simulation studies illustrate that the ensemble method detects the AE signals from synthetic post-market safety datasets pretty accurately across the different scenarios explored. Based on the cases reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) between 2013 and 2022, we further demonstrate that the ensemble method successfully identifies and confirms most of the adverse events that are known to occur most frequently in reaction to antiepileptic drugs and β-lactam antibiotics.","2025","2025-09-23 17:08:03","2025-09-23 17:08:03","","89-101","","1","59","","Ther.

However, their real-world safety profile in a large sample population is incomplete. Objectives: We aimed to provide a pharmacovigilance study of the adverse events (AEs) associated with gilteritinib and midostaurin through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. Design: A retrospective analysis of the FAERS database was conducted by disproportionality analyses. Methods: We conducted disproportionality analyses to identify drug-AE associations, including the reporting odds ratio and the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network. A signal was detected if both methods achieved statistical significance. Results: There were 1887 and 2091 case reports for gilteritinib and midostaurin, respectively. We have separately retained significant disproportionality AEs across two algorithms, with a total of 53 AEs for gilteritinib and 46 for midostaurin. The common AEs observed with gilteritinib included febrile neutropenia, pyrexia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Similarly, the prevalent AEs associated with midostaurin were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, pyrexia, and febrile neutropenia. The common AEs of both drugs are consistent with previous clinical trials. Notably, we also revealed unexpected significant AEs for both drugs. For gilteritinib, 29 positive signals for AEs not mentioned in its instructions were identified, such as cerebral hemorrhage, tumor lysis syndrome, and interstitial lung disease. Midostaurin exhibited 24 positive signals for AEs not listed in its instructions, including neutropenic colitis, neutropenic sepsis, and septic shock. Conclusion: This study highlights the need for continued monitoring and evaluation of these drugs in clinical practice, as it first reveals their AEs in a large real-world sample population. Some AEs are generally consistent with the instructions and previous studies, but some unexpected AEs are detected for each drug. Due to the limitations of the spontaneous report database, such as including potential underreporting, overreporting, lack of causal relationship, unable to calculate incidence, and other confounding factors, more pharmacoepidemiology studies are needed to validate our findings.","2025","2025-09-23 17:08:03","2025-09-23 17:08:03","","","","","16","","Ther.

It is used widely for the prevention and treatment of invasive fungal infections in patients with a hematological malignancy, but studies on its safety in this population are scarce. We assessed the adverse drug events (ADEs) of voriconazole in this population based on the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database to improve understanding of the safety of voriconazole. Research design and methods: ADE reports for patients with a hematological malignant tumor using voriconazole between the first quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2024 were retrieved. Then, they were classified using the preferred terminology (PT) and system organ category (SOC) in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Data mining was done using reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), and multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS). Results: A total of 605 ADEs were included: 116 (19.17%) in children and 489 (80.83%) in adults. The types of SOC involved in children and adults were 22 and 24, respectively. The only positive SOC signal that satisfied all four algorithms simultaneously in children was “psychiatric disorders”, whereas in adults they were “endocrine disorders” and “hepatobiliary disorders”. At the PT level, the types involved in children and adults were 28 and 74, respectively. The highest ROR signal intensities were found for “hallucinations, mixed” in children and “toxic optic neuropathy” in adults. The median time of onset of the ADE in children and adults was 11 and 8.5 days, respectively. Conclusion: We used four algorithms (ROR, PRR, BCPNN, MGPS) to mine the signals of voriconazole in patients with a hematological malignant tumor, and compared the differences between children and adults. This study is important for targeting the monitoring, and could help to improve the safety of voriconazole.","2025","2025-09-23 17:08:03","2025-09-23 17:08:03","","","","","16","","Front.

Methods: We collected and analyzed efgartigimod alfa-related reports from the FAERS database from the first quarter of 2022 through the second quarter of 2024. Disproportionality analysis was used in data mining to quantify efgartigimod alfa-related AE signals. Results: A total of 3,040 reports with efgartigimod alfa as the primary suspect and 12,487 AEs were retrieved from FAERS. The most frequently reported serious outcome was hospitalization (53.22%), and death occurred in 270 cases (8.88%). Disproportionality analysis detected 137 AE signals, with the most common in nervous system disorders (22.69%), general disorders and administration site conditions (16.90%), and infections and infestations (14.05%). Notably, in addition to infection-related AEs identified during clinical trials, this study detected unexpected signals, including inappropriate schedule of product administration (ROR 2.60, PRR 2.53, IC 1.34, EBGM 2.53) and nephrolithiasis (ROR 8.13, PRR 7.99, IC 2.99, EBGM 7.95). The median onset time of AEs was 81.0 days. Conclusion: Our study provides a comprehensive assessment of the post-marketing safety of efgartigimod alfa and highlights the need for continued vigilance regarding infection-related adverse events. Additionally, the detection of inappropriate schedules of product administration underscores the importance of enhanced training and pharmacist involvement in medication management.

However, its neurological safety and tolerability in a large population remain limited. This study aimed to assess the neurological safety and potential risks of baclofen in the real world. Methods: Data covering the period from the first quarter of 2004 to the third quarter of 2024 were collected from the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Four disproportionality analysis methods were employed: the Reporting Odds Ratio, the Proportional Reporting Ratio, Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network, and the Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinkage (MGPS). These methods were used to detect and evaluate adverse events Adverse drug events associated with baclofen. Additionally, the time to onset analysis was conducted. Results: A total of 432 neurological-related preferred terms (PTs) were identified. The number of PT that were positive for all four algorithms was 40, and the top 5 PT were Hypotonia, Encephalopathy, Coma, Unresponsive to stimuli, and Cerebrospinal fluid leakage. The top 5 PTs for ROR values are Intracranial hypotension [ROR 66.24 (55.45–79.13)], Cerebrospinal fluid leakage [ROR 51.34 (45.84–57.51)], Autonomic dysreflexia [ROR 47.4 (32.27–69.63)], Basal ganglion degeneration [ROR 33.03 (18.54–58.84)], Sciatic nerve palsy [ROR 21.6 (11.14–41.87)]. The median onset time for baclofen -related ADEs was 27 days. Most cases (n = 241, 55.5%) occurred within the first month of baclofen administration. In an analysis of severe vs. non-severe ADEs, the study found that the incidence of severe cases was higher than that of non-severe cases, with no gender-related differences observed. Conclusion: This study identified clinically significant PTs using four different algorithms and performed gender subgroup analysis. The TTO analysis indicated that the onset of most ADEs occurred within 27 days. Furthermore, the frequency of severe ADEs was higher than that of non-severe ones. Clinicians should closely monitor for neurological adverse effects caused by baclofen, particularly severe ADEs, and consider individualized dosing strategies. Further research based on real-world data is needed to validate these findings.","2025","2025-09-23 17:08:03","2025-09-23 17:08:03","","","","","16","","Front.

This study characterises age-stratified safety profiles of azithromycin using pharmacovigilance data. Methods: Adverse event (AE) reports for azithromycin prescribed in Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia treatment (2004–2024) were extracted from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Disproportionality analyses (Reporting Odds Ratio, Proportional Reporting Ratio, Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network, Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinker) identified safety signals across four age groups: 0–17, 18–44, 45–64, and ≥65 years. Results: Among 7,496 AE reports, age-specific risks varied significantly. Paediatric populations (0–17 years) exhibited predominant cutaneous/hypersensitivity reactions (rash, pruritus, Stevens-Johnson syndrome) and unlabelled psychiatric signals (hallucinations). Adults (18–44 years) showed pregnancy-related risks (preterm delivery). Geriatric patients (≥65 years) had heightened cardiac risks (QT prolongation, torsades de pointes), often exacerbated by off-label COVID-19 use. The 45–64-year cohort displayed the highest signal frequency, primarily involving drug hypersensitivity. Off-label prescribing accounted for 65% of geriatric AEs. Conclusion: Azithromycin safety profiles differ markedly across age groups. Children face dermatologic and neuropsychiatric risks, while elderly patients are vulnerable to cardiac complications. Strict adherence to labelled indications, age-specific monitoring, and avoidance of off-label use–particularly during public health crises–are critical to mitigating ADRs. These findings underscore the need for stratified clinical decision-making and targeted pharmacovigilance.","2025","2025-09-23 17:08:03","2025-09-23 17:08:03","","","","1","18","","J. pharm. policy pract.","","","","","","","","English","","","","rayyan-281079763","","","","","/home/carolina/Zotero/storage/VQ7YSG7N/Zhang et al. - 2025 - Age-stratified pharmacovigilance of azithromycin a multimethod signal detection analysis in the FAE.pdf","","adult; adverse drug reaction; aged; article; child; data mining; female; Food and Drug Administration; human; major clinical study; male; pharmacovigilance; signal detection; data base; pregnancy; side effect; hallucination; rash; nerve cell network; off label drug use; age; coronavirus disease 2019; drug hypersensitivity; pruritus; torsade de pointes; azithromycin; clinical decision making; geriatric patient; groups by age; drug therapy; QT prolongation; macrolide; Mycoplasma pneumonia; premature labor; special situation for pharmacovigilance; Stevens Johnson syndrome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Using the Open Vigil 2.1 online tool, extract adverse drug event (ADE) report data for voriconazole, posaconazole, and isavuconazole from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database from the time the drugs were marketed up to the third quarter of 2023. Employ the Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) and Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) methods for data mining. Filter out ADE signals detected by both the ROR and PRR methods, and categorize these ADE signals by System Organ Class (SOC) according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA 26.0). Results: A total of 8,898 ADE reports with voriconazole as the primary suspect drug were retrieved, 1,948 for posaconazole, and 944 for isavuconazole. From the basic analysis of the adverse event reports, male patients (50.31%) outnumber female patients (32.11%). In terms of age, the majority of patients are over 45 years old (52.72%). The reports primarily come from the United States, Japan, France, China, and other countries. A total of 607 ADE signals were identified, with 402 for voriconazole, 159 for posaconazole, and 46 for isavuconazole. Voriconazole ADEs primarily involved the following SOCs: Investigations (9.45%), Eye Disorders (8.46%), and Nervous System Disorders (7.21%); Posaconazole ADEs primarily involved the following SOCs: Investigations (13.84%), General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (11.95%), and Nervous System Disorders (6.29%); Isavuconazole ADEs primarily involved the following SOCs: General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (15.22%), Hepatobiliary Disorders (10.87%), and Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders (10.87%). Conclusion: Voriconazole, posaconazole, and isavuconazole all potentially pose safety risks related to hepatobiliary disorders and cardiac disorders. Additionally, voriconazole carries a higher safety risk for eye disorders and nervous system disorders. Newly discovered ADE signals not mentioned in the drug package inserts include voriconazole-induced rhabdomyolysis, posaconazole-induced peripheral neuropathy, and isavuconazole-induced visual impairment and mental confusion. These findings are significant for guiding rational clinical use of these medications.","2025","2025-09-23 17:08:03","2025-09-23 17:08:03","","","","","16","","Front.

The safety of apremilast in elderly patients has not been adequately explored in clinical trials. This study was to evaluate the safety profile of apremilast in young and middle-aged patients and elderly patients separately, through data mining of the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Methods: Reports in the FAERS from the third quarter of 2014 to the second quarter of 2023 were collected and analyzed. Disproportionality analyses (the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), and the multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS) algorithms) were employed to quantify the ADE signals of apremilast in the age groups of 18–65 years and over 65 years. Results: After data cleaning, a total of 54,926 and 14,156 ADE reports were retrieved, with 66 and 61 ADE signals identified in young and middle-aged patients and in elderly patients, respectively. Several unexpected ADE signals not listed in the drug labeling information were detected, including pericarditis, increased cholesterol levels, liver injury, postoperative thrombosis, serum calcium, and parathyroid abnormalities. Furthermore, weight loss, psychiatric abnormalities, and infections in particular sites (ear, bursa mucosa, and central nervous system) were more significant in elderly patients. Conclusions: The study indicated several unexpected ADEs through disproportionality analysis and highlighted unique safety features in the elderly group. These findings may assist clinicians in managing psoriasis with apremilast.","2025","2025-09-23 17:08:03","2025-09-23 17:08:03","","","","1","2025","","Dermatol.

Methods: The study included data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) spanning from the first quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2024. We employed the disproportional analysis approach to analyze the signals of thrombosis-related adverse events associated with TNF-α blockers. Moreover, subgroup analyses were conducted to investigate the circumstances of different age and gender groups. Additionally, the induction time and Weibull distribution were utilized for the further interpretation of the data. Results: During the study period, among 1,382,627 patients in the FAERS database who had adverse events linked to TNF-α inhibitors, 9,714 could be attributed to thrombosis-related adverse events. In the remaining patients, different types of infection events accounted for a large proportion of the proportion. (N = 165,765) Thrombosis-related adverse event signals were detected in all five types of TNF-α inhibitor drugs. Among them, in the analysis of adalimumab, the adverse event signal of postpartum thrombosis was the strongest, and the positive signal of axillary vein thrombosis was the weakest. The analysis based on gender subgroups discovered some positive signals of adverse events that were not observed in the overall population. The Weibull distribution analysis indicated that all five drugs exhibited an premature aging type characteristic, and their induction decreased gradually over time. Conclusion: This study suggests that TNF - α blockers are associated with various adverse events of thrombosis, with different risks in different patient groups and treatment stages. Clinical doctors should assess individual thrombosis risk and closely monitor coagulation related indicators when using TNF - α inhibitors. This study offers valuable insights for optimizing treatment and improving safety.","2025","2025-09-23 17:08:03","2025-09-23 17:08:03","","","","","16","","Front.

However, their safety profiles remain unclear due to limited real-world evidence. This study aims to analyze and compare adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of these drugs using data from the WHO-VigiAccess and FAERS databases. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted using ADR data from the VigiAccess and FAERS databases, focusing on System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) classifications. Descriptive statistics and reporting odds ratio (ROR) analysis were employed to evaluate and compare ADR profiles. Results: Lecanemab and Aducanumab exhibited distinct ADRs. Results from both the VigiAccess and FAERS databases indicated that the most SOC associated with both drugs was nervous system disorders (34.7% in VigiAccess, 36.8% in FAERS). Further multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that Aducanumab was associated with a higher risk of nervous system disorders (OR = 4.72, 95% CI: 3.53–6.39, P < 0.001). Among the reported AEs, headache was the most frequently reported for Lecanemab (9.4% in VigiAccess, 8.96% in FAERS), while Aducanumab was primarily associated with amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) (19.1% in VigiAccess, 23.58% in FAERS). In the blood and lymphatic systems, Anemia was observed in both drugs. However, thrombocyto-penia was more prevalent in Lecanemab, while platelet dysfunction and myelosuppression were more frequently observed in Aducanumab. Additionally, hospitalization and mortality rates were higher for Aducanumab compared to Lecanemab. Conclusion: This study compared the ADRs of Lecanemab and Aducanumab, revealing that ARIA was the most common AE for both drugs. However, Lecanemab showed a lower risk of ARIA, cerebral hemorrhage, and severe events. These findings emphasize the need for further clinical research to clarify the long-term safety and efficacy of both drugs.","2025","2025-09-23 17:08:03","2025-09-23 17:08:03","","","","","16","","Front.

Methods: The FAERS database was queried, data from Q1 of 2004 to Q2 of 2023 were extracted, and AE reports targeting 5 ICMs as the primary suspects were collected. Data mining and analysis were carried out on relevant reports using the reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), and empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM), while the standardized medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) queries (SMQ) was used for systematic classification. Results: A total of 11,155,106 AE reports were retrieved from FAERS, with 2,412 for ioversol, 2,001 for iohexol, 987 for iodixanol, 1,154 for iopamidol, and 3,835 for iopromide. ICM-induced AE occurrence targeted 21 system organ classes (SOCs). A total of 329 significant disproportionality Preferred terms (PTs) conforming to the 4 algorithms were simultaneously retained. The results revealed that the medium and strong adverse drug reaction (ADR) signals of the 5 ICMs largely focused on “respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders,” “general disorders and administration site conditions,” “immune system disorders,” and “skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.” Ioversol (log2ROR = 1.21, Padj = 0.034) and iopromide (log2ROR = 1.32, Padj = 0.004) were both correlated with a higher incidence of a significant ADR signal, namely throat irritation, particularly in females. In addition, ioversol and iopromide also suggested that toxic nephropathy (log2ROR = −2.47, Padj < 0.001) and hyperhidrosis (log2ROR = −1.22, Padj = 0.001) were significant ADR signals, especially in males, respectively. Conclusions: While the AE distribution of the 5 ICMs was consistent, there were variations in specific ADR signal characteristics, warranting further consideration and exploration.","2025","2025-09-23 17:08:02","2025-09-23 17:08:02","","82-90","","1","47","","Clin.

Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a major risk factor for TdP development, but the specific drug combinations that increase this risk have not been extensively studied. Objective: This study aims to identify clinically significant, high-priority DDIs to provide a foundation to minimize the risk of TdP and effectively manage DDI risks in the future. Methods: We used the following 4 frequency statistical models to detect DDI signals using the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database: Ω shrinkage measure, combination risk ratio, chi-square statistic, and additive model. The adverse event of interest was TdP, and the drugs targeted were all registered and classified as “suspect,” “interacting,” or “concomitant drugs” in FAERS. The DDI signals were identified and evaluated using the Lexicomp and Drugs.com databases, supplemented with real-world data from the literature. Results: As of September 2023, this study included 4313 TdP cases, with 721 drugs and 4230 drug combinations that were reported for at least 3 cases. The Ω shrinkage measure model demonstrated the most conservative signal detection, whereas the chi-square statistic model exhibited the closest similarity in signal detection tendency to the Ω shrinkage measure model. The κ value was 0.972 (95% CI 0.942-1.002), and the Ppositive and Pnegative values were 0.987 and 0.985, respectively. We detected 2158 combinations using the 4 frequency statistical models, of which 241 combinations were indexed by Drugs.com or Lexicomp and 105 were indexed by both. The most commonly interacting drugs were amiodarone, citalopram, quetiapine, ondansetron, ciprofloxacin, methadone, escitalopram, sotalol, and voriconazole. The most common combinations were citalopram and quetiapine, amiodarone and ciprofloxacin, amiodarone and escitalopram, amiodarone and fluoxetine, ciprofloxacin and sotalol, and amiodarone and citalopram. Although 38 DDIs were indexed by Drugs.com and Lexicomp, they were not detected by any of the 4 models. Conclusions: Clinical evidence on DDIs is limited, and not all combinations of heart rate–corrected QT interval (QTc)–prolonging drugs result in TdP, even when involving high-risk drugs or those with known risk of TdP.

This study also aims to investigate potential drug–drug interactions that may increase the risk of these ADRs when linezolid is used in combination with other medications. The findings aim to provide guidance for the safe clinical use of linezolid. Methods: Data from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System between 1 July 2014 and 30 June 2024 were analysed to identify linezolid-related neurological ADRs. The Ω shrinkage measure was used to detect drugs associated with an elevated risk of neurological ADRs. Results: A total of 8521 reports of linezolid-related ADRs were retrieved, of which 20.12% (1720 cases) involved neurological ADRs. Forty-five signals of neurological ADRs were detected, with serotonin syndrome (436 cases, reporting odds ratio [ROR] = 43.66, representing 25.35%) and peripheral neuropathy (413 cases, ROR = 7.88, representing 24.01%) being the most prevalent. Additionally, 23 previously undocumented ADR signals and 21 drugs associated with an increased risk of neurological ADRs (Ω 025 > 0) were identified. Conclusion: This study highlights the need for careful monitoring of neurological ADRs associated with linezolid, vigilance regarding previously undocumented ADRs and the prudent management of concomitant medications. These findings provide essential guidance for the safe clinical use of linezolid.","2025","2025-09-23 17:08:02","2025-09-23 17:08:02","","2969-2981","","","18","","J.

Considering the growth in antidepressant prescription rates, SSRI-induced adverse events (AEs) need to be comprehensively clarified. Objective: This study was to investigate safety profiles and potential AEs associated with SSRIs using the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Methods: A retrospective pharmacovigilance analysis was conducted using the FAERS database, with Open Vigil 2.1 used for data extraction. The study included cases from the marketing date of each SSRI (ie, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline) to April 30, 2023. We employed the reporting odds ratio and Bayesian confidence propagation neural network as analytical tools to assess the association between SSRIs and AEs. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities was used to standardize the definition of AEs. AE classification was achieved using system organ classes (SOCs). Results: Overall, 427 655 AE reports were identified for the 6 SSRIs, primarily associated with 25 SOCs, including psychiatric, nervous system, congenital, familial, genetic, cardiac, and reproductive disorders. Notably, sertraline (n = 967) and fluvoxamine (n = 169) exhibited the highest and lowest signal frequencies, respectively. All SSRIs had relatively strong signals related to congenital, psychiatric, and nervous disorders. Conclusions and relevance: Most of our findings are consistent with those reported previously, but some AEs were not previously identified. However, AEs attributed to SSRIs remain ambiguous, warranting further validation. Applying data-mining methods to the FAERS database can provide additional insights that can assist in appropriately utilizing SSRIs.","2024","2025-09-23 17:08:01","2025-09-23 17:08:01","","1105-1116","","11","58","","Ann.

The post-marketing data concerning KRAS (G12C) inhibitors remain limited, and the outcomes of relevant studies are yet to yield conclusive evidence supporting the long-term safety of KRAS (G12C) inhibitors. Materials and methods: This investigation comprehensively assessed adverse events (AEs) attributed to KRAS (G12C) inhibitors by employing advanced data mining techniques, utilizing the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). The dataset encompasses the period from the first quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2024. A disproportionality analysis was conducted to quantify the correlation between KRAS (G12C) inhibitors and AEs. The metrics employed for the evaluation of disproportionality comprise the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the information component (IC), and the empirical Bayesian geometric mean (EBGM). Results: A total of 2,253 and 486 reports were identified as related to sotorasib and adagrasib, with the identification of 51 and 26 preferred terms, respectively. The most frequent AEs of sotorasib comprised diarrhoea (ROR 5.27), hepatotoxicity (ROR 38.09), alanine aminotransferase increased (ROR 17.41), aspartate aminotransferase increased (ROR 20.88), and hepatic function abnormal (ROR 19.88). The most common AEs of adagrasib included diarrhoea (ROR 4.21), nausea (ROR 3.84), vomiting (ROR 5.36), decreased appetite (ROR 4.79), and dehydration (ROR 7.00). A relatively reduced risk of hepatotoxicity but a increased risk of serious AEs in adagrasib compared to sotorasib (P < 0.001).

Despite their therapeutic benefits, mAb therapy has been associated with neurological toxicity. Objectives: This study aimed to assess the occurrence of neuronal toxicity associated with mAbs, utilizing data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) safety database. The study also sought to delineate the medical characteristics of the reported cases. Methods: A comprehensive analysis of neurological adverse events reported in the FAERS database was conducted, employing computational methodologies such as proportional relative risk (PRR), information component (IC025), and chi-square (χ2). Individual case safety reports (ICSRs) pertaining to neurological disorders linked to mAbs from the date of first global marketing authorization until June 30, 2023, were meticulously examined. Results: The FAERS safety database contains 79,022 ICSRs linking mAbs to nervous system disorders. Rituximab, bevacizumab, denosumab, nivolumab, and trastuzumab were frequently cited. Reported adverse events include headache, peripheral neuropathy, dizziness, and cerebrovascular accident. Most ICSRs (85.81%) were serious, mainly affecting females (57.04%) with a 14.09% fatality rate. Panitumumab, atezolizumab, bevacizumab, and trastuzumab showed strong drug-event associations. Signal disproportionate reporting (SDR) analysis flagged myasthenia gravis, peripheral neuropathy, and neurotoxicity across multiple mAbs, suggesting potential signals. Conclusions: Interdisciplinary collaboration between oncologists and neurologists is crucial for safe mAb use. Our study enhances understanding of mAb neurological safety.

SGAs also demonstrate antagonistic affinity for D2 receptors, indicating their potential to induce EPSs. This study utilized the Korea Adverse Event Reporting System (KAERS) database to explore adverse drug event (ADE) signals related to both FGAs and SGAs. Materials and Methods: Relevant ADE reports from January 2013 to December 2022 were extracted from the KAERS database and analyzed using disproportionality analysis, employing the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), reporting odds ratio (ROR), and information component (IC) with its 95% lower confidence interval (LCI) indices. Results: Of the initial dataset of 2,890,702 ADE reports, those with insufficient data and duplicates were removed, resulting in a final dataset of 5249 reports for analysis. Aripiprazole, an SGA, showed signals for movement disorders, including EPSs (PRR 4.7, ROR 4.8, IC 2.2), tremors (PRR 5.3, ROR 5.4, IC 2.4), and akathisia (PRR 18.6, ROR 19.3, IC 3.5). Notably, for quetiapine, cardiovascular signals were detected, including increased blood pressure (PRR 2.1, ROR 2.3, IC 0.5), and tachyarrhythmia (PRR 13.9, ROR 14.1, IC 1.8), along with peripheral edema (PRR 2.5, ROR 2.5, IC 0.2). Metabolic abnormalities, such as weight gain and increased appetite, were identified for four SGAs: aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone. Safety signals related to movement disorders were not detectable for FGAs, likely due to the limited number of ADE reports available for analysis. Conclusions: Our study findings support that the distribution of ADEs between FGAs and SGAs is not strictly binary. Aripiprazole, despite being an SGA, showed signals for extrapyramidal movement disorders. Four SGAs (aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone) were linked to metabolic side effects, while quetiapine was associated with cardiovascular safety signals.","2024","2025-09-23 17:08:00","2025-09-23 17:08:00","","","","10","60","","Medicina (Kaunas)","","","","","","","","English","","","","rayyan-281079778","","","","","/home/carolina/Zotero/storage/BSJAHSSE/Moon et al. - 2024 - Real-World Data Mining for Signal Detection of Antipsychotics-Associated Adverse Events Using the Ko.pdf","","adolescent; adult; adverse drug reaction; aged; article; cohort analysis; automutilation; algorithm; abnormal behavior; abnormal dreaming; altered state of consciousness; Adult; Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems; Aged; Antipsychotic Agents; Article; Adverse events; adverse outcome; antipsychotics; ASPIRIN; CHEMOTHERAPY; COMBINATION; *Data Mining; automation; bevacizumab; clopidogrel; comparative study; adverse events; anemia; apraxia; arthralgia; arthritis; cataract; acute kidney failure; *Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/epidemiology; *Social Media; adverse drug events; breast cancer; colitis; computer model; cancer chemotherapy; aphasia; alanine aminotransferase; alanine aminotransferase blood level; aspartate aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; bilirubin; bilirubin blood level; ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS; cardiovascular risk; *United States Food and Drug Administration; aggression; agitation; amfebutamone; antihypertensive agent; budesonide; bupivacaine; carboplatin; amnesia; attention disturbance; behavior disorder; cognitive defect; chemically induced; cancer therapy; blepharospasm; *Antipsychotic Agents/adverse effects; adverse drug event; alirocumab; case study; ANTIBODIES; *Databases, Factual; airway obstruction; anhedonia; anxiety; bruxism; *Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems/statistics & numerical data; anger; apathy; bradyphrenia; *Data Mining/methods; Antihypertensive Agents; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; autoimmune hepatitis; abnormal thinking; adrenal insufficiency; advanced cancer; ADVERSE CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS; alcoholism; ALGORITHMS; analogs and derivatives; analytic method; ANTI-CTLA-4; Antihypertensive Agents/adverse effects; aphonia; appetite disorder; APPROVAL; asomatognosia; ASSOCIATION; attitude to health; avoidant restrictive food intake disorder; Basal Ganglia Diseases; Basal Ganglia Diseases/chemically induced/epidemiology; bimatoprost; bipolar I disorder; blood cell count; brain injury; cancer survival; CANCER-PATIENTS; CAPTURE; cardiovascular mortality; carvedilol; Charles Bonnet syndrome; CHECKPOINT BLOCKADE; CHECKPOINT INHIBITORS; clinical decision support system; clinical trial; CLOPIDOGREL; colorectal cancer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Data was collected in FAERS from the second quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2023 for data cleaning. Neurological adverse event (AE) signals of valbenazine were mined by calculating reporting odds ratios (ROR), information component (IC) and empirical Bayesian geometric mean (EBGM). The serious and non-serious cases and signals were prioritized using a rating scale. Results: The number of neurological AE reports where the primary suspect (PS) drug was 8981 for valbenazine. Significant AE signals were identified by the preferred term (PT) analysis for valbenazine, including somnolence (ROR 19.69), tremor (ROR 15.17), and tardive dyskinesia (ROR 236.91), among which 18 AEs were identified as new signals. Patient age (p < 0.009) and sex (p = 0.197) might be associated with an increased risk of neurological AE severity. Notably, the association between valbenazine and neurological disorders remained when stratified by sex, age, and reporter type. AE timing analysis was performed for the drug and four moderate clinical priority signals [i.e., somnolence, balance disorder, parkinsonism, and akathisia (priorities 7)], showing the same early failure type profiles. Conclusions: The increase in neurological safety signals is identified in the post-marketing research of valbenazine.

However, investigations into its adverse drug reactions remain scant. This study seeks to utilize data mining techniques with the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database to assess adverse drug events (ADEs) linked to bempedoic acid. Methods: Based on the drug's market release timeline, we extracted data from the FAERS database covering the fourth quarter of 2020 through the fourth quarter of 2023 for disproportionality analysis. Results: This study gathered a total of 5,797,543 adverse event case reports, of which 735 were linked to bempedoic acid. These reports covered 19 System Organ Classes (SOCs) and 22 Preferred Terms (PTs). Predominantly, the musculoskeletal and nervous systems were implicated in these adverse events. By conducting PT-level screening, various signals for ADEs were detected, including myalgia (ROR 30.33, PRR 28.51, IC 4.83, EBGM 28.47), arthralgia (n = 34, ROR 6.34, PRR 6.09, IC 2.61, EBGM 6.09), tendon disorders (ROR 99.57, PRR 98.75, IC 6.62, EBGM 98.28), and dizziness (ROR 3.18, PRR 3.13, IC 1.65, EBGM 3.13). Particularly noteworthy was the hypertensive crisis (ROR 28.63, PRR 28.51, IC 4.83, EBGM 28.47), which exhibited a robust signal strength, an observation previously unreported in clinical studies and drug labeling. Conclusion: While our results are largely consistent with the drug's specifications, several new adverse reaction signals, such as hypertensive crisis, have not been previously documented. Therefore, further investigations are necessary to assess these unlabeled adverse reactions, offering crucial support for the clinical utilization of bempedoic acid.","2024","2025-09-23 17:08:00","2025-09-23 17:08:00","","","","","412","","Int.

It is particularly beneficial when dealing with hierarchical data structures. One may use a retrospective case-control study design from spontaneous reporting systems (SRS) to investigate whether a specific adverse event of interest is associated with certain drugs. However, the existing Bernoulli model of the tree-based scan statistic may not be suitable as it fails to adequately account for dependencies within matched pairs. In this article, we propose signal detection statistics for matched case-control data based on McNemar's test, Wald test for conditional logistic regression, and the likelihood ratio test for a multinomial distribution. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform the existing approach in terms of the type I error rate, power, sensitivity, and false detection rate. To illustrate our proposed approach, we applied the three methods and the existing method to detect drug signals for dizziness-related adverse events related to antihypertensive drugs using the database of the Korea Adverse Event Reporting System.","2024","2025-09-23 17:08:00","2025-09-23 17:08:00","","1112-1121","","4","25","","Biostatistics","","","","","","","","English","","","","rayyan-281079782","","","","","/home/carolina/Zotero/storage/A44NKNIS/Heo et al. - 2024 - Signal detection statistics of adverse drug events in hierarchical structure for matched case-contro.pdf","","adolescent; adult; adverse drug reaction; aged; article; child; cohort analysis; clinical feature; data base; abdominal pain; algorithm; adverse event; anaphylaxis; controlled study; cyanosis; Adolescent; Adult; Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems; Aged; Article; adverse drug reactions; age; allergy; anaphylactoid reaction; Bayes theorem; cytarabine; data analysis; acetylsalicylic acid; Adverse drug reaction; antineoplastic agent; Antineoplastic Agents; automation; CANCER; Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems/*statistics & numerical data; adverse events; canagliflozin; dapagliflozin; *Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/epidemiology; *Pharmacovigilance; Adverse drug reactions; backache; Bayes Theorem; Blogging; coughing; cellulitis; autonomic neuropathy; area under the curve; classifier; Cohort Studies; agitation; antihypertensive agent; cefprozil; ceftriaxone; celecoxib; biguanide; bone marrow suppression; Data Collection; computer simulation; Computer Simulation; CERIVASTATIN; amphetamine derivative; *Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems/statistics & numerical data; *Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects; *Data Mining/methods; adderall; Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems/*standards; adverse event reporting; amphetamine plus dexamphetamine; Amphetamines; analytical error; Antihypertensive Agents; attention deficit disorder; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; billing and claims; blogging; Blogging/statistics & numerical data; Boxed Warning; breast feeding; Breast Feeding; CARE; case control study; CASE SERIES; Case-Control Studies; cefaclor; cefadroxil; cefalexin; cefalotin; cefamandole; cefamandole nafate; cefathiamidine; cefazedone; cefazolin; cefdinir; cefepime; cefixime; cefmenoxime; cefodizime; cefonicid; cefoperazone; cefoselis; cefotaxime; cefotiam; cefpiramide; cefpodoxime proxetil; cefradine; ceftazidime; ceftezole; ceftizoxime; cefuroxime; cefuroxime axetil; central nervous system agents; cephalosporin; ceralasertib; children; Cholinergic Antagonists; cholinergic receptor blocking agent; Cluster analysis; Cohort study; comprehensive standard method; Computer aided analysis; COST; COX-3; CRITICALLY-ILL PATIENTS; data collection method","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is a lack of large-scale data relating to adverse events (AEs) related to its use. We aimed to explore the avapritinib-related AEs in real-world practice based on the post-marketing data. Methods: We extracted all avapritinib-related reports submitted to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) by June 2022. Based on disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis, we then calculated the reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), information component (IC) and empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM) to evaluate whether there is a significant association between avapritinib and AEs. Gender, age and time to onset were comparable between haemorrhage/non-haemorrhage, serious/non-serious, death/non-death AEs, respectively. Results: In total, 3120 cases related to avapritinib were documented in the FAERS database, and 44% were reported within 30 days of commencing avapritinib. A total of 331 different AE signals were detected, and no significant differences between males and females was identified. Although the number of AEs associated with an abnormal skin texture and executive dysfunction was small, the signal intensity is high, suggesting that these events are strongly correlated with avapritinib. Subgroup analysis showed that elderly male patients were more likely to suffer from serious AEs compared to females (P <.01), but there was no significant difference between the haemorrhage group and the non-haemorrhage group. Analysis of fatalities due to avapritinib-related AEs indicated that sex, age and time-to-onset were all significantly related to death (P <.05). Conclusion: Our study provides a more precise description of the incidence and characteristics of AEs after using avapritinib, clinicians should be particularly careful when prescribing avapritinib to elderly male patients, especially within the 30 days.","2024","2025-09-23 17:08:00","2025-09-23 17:08:00","","1816-1826","","8","90","","Br.

Our study aimed to detect sevoflurane-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus using data mining algorithms (DMAs) and molecular docking. The FAERS database was analysed using OpenVigil 2.1 for disproportionality analysis. Methods: We analysed FAERS data from 2004 to 2022 to determine the incidence of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus associated with sevoflurane. Reporting odds ratios (RORs) and proportional reporting ratios (PRRs) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. We also used molecular docking with AutoDock Vina to examine sevoflurane's binding affinity to relevant receptors. Results: A total of 554 nephrogenic diabetes insipidus cases were reported in FAERS, of which 2.5% (14 cases) were associated with sevoflurane. Positive signals were observed for sevoflurane with ROR of 76.012 (95% CI: 44.67–129.35) and PRR of 75.72 (χ2: 934.688). Of the 14 cases, 50% required hospitalization, 14% resulted in death, and the remaining cases were categorized as other outcomes. Molecular docking analysis showed that sevoflurane exhibited high binding affinity towards AQP2 (4NEF) and AVPR2 (6U1N) with docking scores of −4.9 and −5.3, respectively. Conclusions: Sevoflurane use is significantly associated with the incidence of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Healthcare professionals should be cautious when using this medication and report any adverse events to regulatory agencies. Further research is needed to validate these findings and identify risk factors while performing statistical adjustments to prevent false-positives. Clinical monitoring is crucial to validate potential adverse effects of sevoflurane.","2024","2025-09-23 17:08:00","2025-09-23 17:08:00","","1804-1810","","8","90","","Br. J. Clin.

This study comprehensively analyzed the adverse event (AE) risk signals of the currently approved gepants using the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database, aiming to gain better understanding of their post-marketing safety features and potential risks. Methods: All data of the gepants (rimegepant, atogepant, ubrogepant, and zavegepant) from January 1st 2020 to December 31st 2024 were retrieved from the database. Descriptive analysis was conducted to characterize the features of gepant-associated AEs. Disproportionality analysis and subsequent sensitivity analysis were employed to evaluate the risk signals of the gepants utilizing the algorithms of reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), and information component (IC). Results: A total of 7766 reports of rimegepant, 3672 reports of atogepant, 1958 reports of ubrogepant, and 463 reports of zavegepant were identified after data processing. Most AEs were occurred within 30 days after gepant administration. The integration of disproportionality analysis and sensitivity analysis indicated that “feeling abnormal” was the most reported AE of rimegepant (n = 185, 6.81%, ROR025 = 6.46, IC025 = 2.59, PRR = 7.24, χ2 = 998.58), while “constipation” was the most common AE of atogepant (n = 288, 16.09%, ROR025 = 19.99, IC025 = 4.10, PRR = 20.72, χ2 = 5418.12). The most prevalent AE of ubrogepant was “fatigue” (n = 60, 7.19%, ROR025 = 1.88, IC025 = 0.84, PRR = 2.38, χ2 = 48.82), whereas “dysgeusia” was the most frequently observed AE of zavegepant (n = 150, 45.18%, ROR025 = 212.07, IC025 = 6.10, PRR = 181.96, χ2 = 26,975.74). Comparative analysis of AEs revealed that two AEs were shared among all gepants and zavegepant had the largest collection of unique AEs (n = 15). Conclusions: The present pharmacovigilance study systematically revealed the significant risk signals of gepants. The common AEs and unique AEs of the four gepants were also identified and explored. Our results would provide valuable reference for the safe use of gepants, guiding personalized drug selection in clinical practice.","2025","2025-09-23 17:07:59","2025-09-23 17:07:59","","","","1","26","","J.
