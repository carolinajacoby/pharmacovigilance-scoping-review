rayyan-281079716,From narrative descriptions to MedDRA: automagically encoding adverse drug reactions,2018,8,1,Journal of Biomedical Informatics,1532-0464,84,,184-199,"Combi, Carlo and Zorzi, Margherita and Pozzani, Gabriele and Moretti, Ugo and Arzenton, Elena",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046418301278,,,,"Context     The collection of narrative spontaneous reports is an irreplaceable source for the prompt detection of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs). In such task qualified domain experts manually revise a huge amount of narrative descriptions and then encode texts according to MedDRA standard terminology. The manual annotation of narrative documents with medical terminology is a subtle and expensive task, since the number of reports is growing up day-by-day.     Objectives     Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications can support the work of people responsible for pharmacovigilance. Our objective is to develop NLP algorithms and tools for the detection of ADR clinical terminology. Efficient applications can concretely improve the quality of the experts’ revisions. NLP software can quickly analyze narrative texts and offer an encoding (i.e., a list of MedDRA terms) that the expert has to revise and validate.     Methods     MagiCoder, an NLP algorithm, is proposed for the automatic encoding of free-text descriptions into MedDRA terms. MagiCoder procedure is efficient in terms of computational complexity. We tested MagiCoder through several experiments. In the first one, we tested it on a large dataset of about 4500 manually revised reports, by performing an automated comparison between human and MagiCoder encoding. Moreover, we tested MagiCoder on a set of about 1800 reports, manually revised ex novo by some experts of the domain, who also compared automatic solutions with the gold reference standard. We also provide two initial experiments with reports written in English, giving a first evidence of the robustness of MagiCoder w.r.t. the change of the language.     Results     For the current base version of MagiCoder, we measured an average recall and precision of 86.9% and 91.8%, respectively.     Conclusions     From a practical point of view, MagiCoder reduces the time required for encoding ADR reports. Pharmacologists have only to review and validate the MedDRA terms proposed by the application, instead of choosing the right terms among the 70 K low level terms of MedDRA. Such improvement in the efficiency of pharmacologists’ work has a relevant impact also on the quality of the subsequent data analysis. We developed MagiCoder for the Italian pharmacovigilance language. However, our proposal is based on a general approach, not depending on the considered language nor the term dictionary.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: H.

Although researchers have attempted to  investigate DDIs from biomedical texts and predict unknown DDIs, the lack of  accurate manual annotations significantly hinders the performance of machine  learning algorithms. In this study, a new DDI prediction framework, Subgraph  Enhance model, was developed for DDI (SubGE-DDI) to improve the performance of  machine learning algorithms. This model uses drug pairs knowledge subgraph  information to achieve large-scale plain text prediction without many  annotations. This model treats DDI prediction as a multi-class classification  problem and predicts the specific DDI type for each drug pair (e.g. Mechanism,  Effect, Advise, Interact and Negative). The drug pairs knowledge subgraph was  derived from a huge drug knowledge graph containing various public datasets, such  as DrugBank, TwoSIDES, OffSIDES, DrugCentral, EntrezeGene, SMPDB (The Small  Molecule Pathway Database), CTD (The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database) and  SIDER. The SubGE-DDI was evaluated from the public dataset (SemEval-2013 Task 9  dataset) and then compared with other state-of-the-art baselines. SubGE-DDI  achieves 83.91% micro F1 score and 84.75% macro F1 score in the test dataset,  outperforming the other state-of-the-art baselines. These findings show that the  proposed drug pairs knowledge subgraph-assisted model can effectively improve the  prediction performance of DDIs from biomedical texts.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: B.-S.

We prospectively  evaluated a method for integrated local detection and prediction (nowcasting) of  influenza epidemics over 5 years, using the total population in Östergötland  County, Sweden. We used routine health information system data on  influenza-diagnosis cases and syndromic telenursing data for July 2009-June 2014  to evaluate epidemic detection, peak-timing prediction, and peak-intensity  prediction. Detection performance was satisfactory throughout the period, except  for the 2011-12 influenza A(H3N2) season, which followed a season with influenza  B and pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus activity. Peak-timing prediction  performance was satisfactory for the 4 influenza seasons but not the pandemic.  Peak-intensity levels were correctly categorized for the pandemic and 2 of 4  influenza seasons. We recommend using versions of this method modified with  regard to local use context for further evaluations using standard methods.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: G.

rayyan-281079720,Interaction between dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors and drugs acting on renin angiotensin aldosterone system for the risk of angioedema: a pharmacovigilance assessment using disproportionality and interaction analyses,2025,,,Diabetology and Metabolic Syndrome,1758-5996,17,1,,"Sridharan, K. and Sivaramakrishnan, G.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2032853952&from=export,English,,,"Background: Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4is) and drugs interfering with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) are frequently co-prescribed in type 2 diabetes management. Both drug classes have been independently associated with angioedema, raising concerns about potential interaction risks. This study aimed to evaluate the safety signals and interaction patterns for angioedema associated with DPP-4is alone and in combination with RAAS-interfering drugs. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive pharmacovigilance analysis using the United States Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (USFDA AERS) database. Disproportionality analyses employing both frequentist (Reporting Odds Ratio, Proportional Reporting Ratio) and Bayesian approaches were performed. Drug-drug interactions were assessed using multiplicative drug-drug interaction model. Additionally, we reviewed published case reports of DPP-4i-associated angioedema. Results: Analysis of 29,163,222 reports identified 588 cases of DPP-4i-associated angioedema. Significant safety signals were detected for DPP-4i monotherapies, while combinations with RAAS-interfering drugs demonstrated stronger signals through both frequentist and Bayesian analyses. Significant interaction signals were observed for sitagliptin/irbesartan, sitagliptin/valsartan, linagliptin/valsartan and alogliptin/lisinopril combinations. Alogliptin/lisinopril and sitagliptin/irbesartan combinations showed the highest risk profiles. Angioedema occurred predominantly in elderly patients (> 65 years) and females. Sixteen case reports corroborated the findings from the database assessment. Clinical outcomes were comparable between monotherapy and combination therapy groups. Conclusion: This pharmacovigilance analysis reveals significant safety signals for angioedema with specific DPP-4i combinations with RAAS-interfering drugs, suggesting potential drug-drug interactions. These findings emphasize the need for careful patient monitoring, particularly in vulnerable populations, when prescribing these combinations. Further prospective studies are warranted to validate these findings and establish definitive causal relationships.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: J.

However, real-world studies assessing its safety in large populations are lacking. As such, this study aimed to comprehensively evaluate real-world adverse drug events (ADEs) linked to paliperidone palmitate by employing data mining techniques on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database and the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database. Methods: The study retrieved ADE reports from the FAERS database covering the period from 2009 through the third quarter of 2024, and from the JADER database covering the period from 2013 through the second quarter of 2024. Utilizing disproportionality analyses such as the reporting odds ratios (ROR), proportional reporting ratios (PRR), Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), and multi-item Poisson shrinkage (MGPS), significant associations between ADEs and paliperidone palmitate were evaluated. Results: A total of 27,672 ADE reports related to paliperidone palmitate were identified in FAERS, with 285 significantly disproportionate preferred terms (PTs) identified by all four algorithms. Paliperidone palmitate-associated ADEs encompassed 27 System Organ Classes (SOCs). The top three PTs with the highest reported cases were off-label use, drug ineffective, and hospitalization. Common ADEs included increased blood prolactin, galactorrhea, and schizophrenia, which was consistent with drug label. Noteworthy, unexpected signals not listed in the drug label were also identified, such as psychosexual disorders, prolactin-producing pituitary tumors, suicide attempt, and sudden death. The median onset time for all ADEs was 40 days. Furthermore, gender-based difference in risk signals was detected. Females are more likely to experience elevated blood prolactin and weight increase, whereas males are more prone to sexual dysfunction. Among the 1,065 ADE reports from the JADER database, we identified 51 positive signals, 35 of which overlapped with those found in FAERS, including schizophrenia, hyperprolactinemia, and erectile dysfunction. Conclusion: The study findings from two independent databases serve as crucial references for ensuring the safe of paliperidone palmitate.

This study aimed to evaluate the adverse events (AEs) of IDH inhibitors based on the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. Methods: AE reports for IDH inhibitors (enasidenib, ivosidenib, and olutasidenib) were collected and analyzed from the time of launch through the first quarter of 2024. Only IDH inhibitors reported as the target drug and coded as the primary suspect (PS) were included in the analysis. AEs were standardized and classified according to the preferred term (PT) and system organ classification (SOC) in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 26.0. Disproportionality analyses including the reporting odds ratio and the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network were performed in data mining to assess IDH inhibitor-relatedAEs. Differentiation syndrome was the AE of special interest. Results: The reports number of enasidenib, ivosidenib, and olutasidenib was 11 616 357, 10 067 250, and 2 563 464, respectively. A total of 80 enasidenib-related signals involving 15 SOCs, 78 ivosidenib-related signals involving 17 SOCs, and 7 olutasidenib-related signals involving 4 SOCs were obtained. The most signals reported were “blood and lymphatic system disorders,” “infections and infestations,” and “nervous system disorders” in enasidenib. For signals of ivosidenib, the most frequently reported were “gastrointestinal disorders,” “general disorders and administration site conditions,” and “injury, poisoning and procedural complications.” Ivosidenib was the only IDH inhibitor with signals in “cardiac disorders.” Differentiation syndrome events were reported in 89, 40, and 2 cases for enasidenib, ivosidenib, and olutasidenib, respectively. The median time to onset was 26–31 days for ivosidenib and enasidenib. AML was the most common indication in the differentiation syndrome reports. Conclusions: Our study identifies potential AE signals associated with IDH inhibitors and provides a broader understanding of the safety. The safety profiles highlight the need for long-term safety monitoring of IDH inhibitor recipients. Promptly monitoring and intervention in specific organ systems depending on the type of IDH inhibitor may improve the overall survival or enhance the quality of life. In the future, it will be necessary to validate our findings in prospective large-scale studies and to investigate the underlying mechanisms.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: Y.

Despite the lack of long-term post-marketing safety studies, this drug was cited with a black box warning by the FDA for potentially increasing the risk of several severe adverse events (AEs). This retrospective pharmacovigilance disproportionality analysis study used data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from the first quarter of 2022 to the first quarter of 2024, aiming to analyze the potential association between abrocitinib and skin AEs. Three disproportionality measurement were performed for data mining, including the reporting odd ratio method, the proportional reporting ratio method and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency method. Out of 3,269,835 AE reports extracted from the database, 699 cases of skin-related AEs were identified, where abrocitinib was implicated as the primary suspect drug. The patient demographic information, outcomes and report sources were analyzed. 34 kinds of positive risk signals were detected, many of which were unexpected safety signals.

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate adverse drug events (ADEs) associated with baloxavir marboxil by analyzing the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. Methods: Adverse event reports involving baloxavir marboxil were extracted from the FAERS database spanning the fourth quarter of 2018 to the third quarter of 2023. Demographic characteristics and reporter profiles were analyzed to characterize the exposed population. A disproportionality analysis was performed using four validated pharmacovigilance algorithms: reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), and multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS). These complementary approaches were employed to detect, prioritize, and validate potential safety signals. Results: Analysis of 8,824,675 ADE reports from the FAERS database identified 1,654 cases (0.19%) associated with baloxavir marboxil. Pediatric patients (< 18 years) exhibited the highest ADE reporting rate. Geospatial analysis revealed marked clustering, with 98.97% of reports originating from the United States (63.2%) and Japan (35.77%). We detected 47 significant safety signals spanning 27 System Organ Classes (SOCs), including established reactions such as pneumonia (n = 90) and vomiting (n = 77). Novel signals emerging from the analysis comprised hemorrhagic diathesis (n = 3), rhabdomyolysis (n = 25), hepatic dysfunction (n = 13), and cardiorespiratory arrest (n = 7). Notably, bleeding-related events (e.g., ischemic colitis, IC025 = 5.03) and neurological complications (e.g., febrile delirium, IC025 = 9.12) demonstrated statistically significant associations. Conclusion: This pharmacovigilance study identifies previously undercharacterized safety signals associated with baloxavir marboxil, including hemorrhagic complications, liver dysfunction, rhabdomyolysis, and life-threatening cardiorespiratory events. Pediatric populations and patients on anticoagulants may require heightened monitoring. While these findings provide critical pharmacovigilance insights, our study is inherently constrained by the spontaneous reporting system, which introduces potential underreporting, reporting biases, and confounding factors. Future research could employ more rigorous prospective study designs, integrating clinical trials and epidemiological studies, to more accurately assess the safety risks of baloxavir marboxil.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Silvio""=>""Included"", ""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.1186/s40360-025-00940-0,abnormal behavior;abnormal dreaming;adolescent;adult;adverse event;aged;algorithm;altered state of consciousness;anaphylaxis;anticoagulant agent;article;baloxavir marboxil;Bayesian network;bleeding tendency;brain disease;bronchitis;cardiopulmonary insufficiency;child;clinical monitoring;confounding variable;controlled study;cyanosis;cystitis;data base;data mining;demographics;depression;disseminated intravascular clotting;drug eruption;drug use;enterocolitis;erythema multiforme;eyelid swelling;face edema;facial nerve paralysis;febrile delirium;female;Food and Drug Administration;hallucination;human;human tissue;influenza;ischemic colitis;Japan;lip swelling;liver dysfunction;longitudinal study;lower respiratory tract infection;major clinical study;male;melena;middle aged;observational study;odds ratio;paralytic ileus;pediatric patient;pharmacovigilance;pneumonia;rhabdomyolysis;risk assessment;seizure;shock;side effect;spatial analysis;unconsciousness;United States;urticaria;vomiting,,

This study comprehensively analyzed the adverse event (AE) risk signals of the currently approved gepants using the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database, aiming to gain better understanding of their post-marketing safety features and potential risks. Methods: All data of the gepants (rimegepant, atogepant, ubrogepant, and zavegepant) from January 1st 2020 to December 31st 2024 were retrieved from the database. Descriptive analysis was conducted to characterize the features of gepant-associated AEs. Disproportionality analysis and subsequent sensitivity analysis were employed to evaluate the risk signals of the gepants utilizing the algorithms of reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), and information component (IC). Results: A total of 7766 reports of rimegepant, 3672 reports of atogepant, 1958 reports of ubrogepant, and 463 reports of zavegepant were identified after data processing. Most AEs were occurred within 30 days after gepant administration. The integration of disproportionality analysis and sensitivity analysis indicated that “feeling abnormal” was the most reported AE of rimegepant (n = 185, 6.81%, ROR025 = 6.46, IC025 = 2.59, PRR = 7.24, χ2 = 998.58), while “constipation” was the most common AE of atogepant (n = 288, 16.09%, ROR025 = 19.99, IC025 = 4.10, PRR = 20.72, χ2 = 5418.12).

Methods: Data from the FAERS database since Brexanolone's approval in 2019 were extracted, categorizing and analyzing AEs based on frequency and signal strength. Signal detection was conducted using frequency and Bayesian methods to assess the statistical association between AEs and Brexanolone. Results: A total of 234 Brexanolone-related AE reports were collected. Signal detection results revealed a significant association between Brexanolone and multiple system-organ AEs. Intravenous infusion-related events were notably frequent, including Product Administration Error (35 cases), Incorrect Drug Monitoring Procedure (19 cases), Product Administration Interrupted (14 cases), Incorrect Product Administration Duration (11 cases), and Medication Error (10 cases). These findings indicate a need for more standardized management of Brexanolone administration in clinical practice. Common psychiatric AEs were identified, including Perinatal Depression, Intrusive Thoughts, Electroencephalogram Abnormality, Panic Disorder, Tearfulness, Self-Injurious Ideation, Sedation Complication, and Feelings of Despair. Of these, Tearfulness, Self-Injurious Ideation, Sedation Complication, Feelings of Despair, and Crying are known AEs of Brexanolone. Signal strengths for Perinatal Depression, Intrusive Thoughts, Electroencephalogram Abnormality, and Panic Disorder indicate new potential AEs.

Since data mining methods have been developed to identify signals of drug-drug interaction-induced (DDI-induced) or drug-host interaction-induced (DHI-induced) ADE from real-world data, we aim to develop a new method to detect adverse drug-drug interaction with a special awareness on patient characteristics. Methods: We developed a trajectory-informed model (TIM) to identify signals of adverse DDI with a special awareness on patient characteristics (i.e., drug-drug-host interaction [DDHI]). We also proposed a study design based on an optimal selection of within-subject and between-subjects controls for detecting ADEs from real-world data. We analyzed a large-scale US administrative claims data and conducted a simulation study. Results: In administrative claims data analysis, we developed optimally matched case-control datasets for potential ADEs including acute kidney injury and gastrointestinal bleeding. We identified that an optimal selection of controls had a higher AUC compared to traditional designs for ADE detection (AUCs: 0.79–0.80 vs. 0.56–0.76). We observed that TIM detected more signals than reference methods (odds ratios: 1.13–3.18, P < 0.01), and found that 36 % of all signals generated by TIM were DDHI signals. In a simulation study, we demonstrated that TIM had an empirical false discovery rate (FDR) less than the desired value of 0.05, as well as > 1.4-fold higher probabilities of detection of DDHI signals than reference methods. Conclusions: TIM had a high probability to identify signals of adverse DDI and DDHI in a high-throughput ADE mining while controlling false positive rate. A significant portion of drug-drug combinations were associated with an increased risk of ADEs only in specific patient subpopulations. Optimal selection of within-subject and between-subjects controls could improve the performance of ADE data mining.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: J.J.

Objective: To describe patterns of medications reported to the Medicare hospice benefit after the 2014 policy change. Methods: Repeated cross-sectional analysis of medications reported to the Medicare hospice benefit between 2014 and 2018. Data sources include the Medicare Master Beneficiary Summary File and national revenue center claims submissions by Medicare-certified hospices. Main outcome measures by year were the mean number of overall and chronic disease medication dispensing per enrollee, the most common medications billed to the Medicare hospice program, and the proportion of medications for end-of-life, chronic diseases, and potentially inappropriate by Screening Tool of Older Persons Prescriptions in Frail criteria. Results: Between 2014 and 2015, the mean number of dispensings per enrollee covered by hospice temporarily increased from 12.1 (standard deviation (SD) 21.5) to 12.4 (SD 23.4) (P<.001) and returned to 12.1 (SD 23.0) in 2016, while the mean number of chronic disease medication dispensings per enrollee increased from 2.8 (SD 2.2) to 3.2.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This phase 2, randomized, prospective, double-blinded trial enrolled adults with uncontrolled hypertension from 150 sites across 8 countries between January 2022 and June 2023. The final follow-up date was December 11, 2023, and analyses were conducted on March 1, 2024. Interventions: Eligible patients were initially randomized in cohorts to receive open-label run-in treatment for at least 4 weeks with indapamide 2.5 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, or olmesartan 40 mg (4:7:10 randomization), each administered once daily. Within cohorts, adherent patients with 24-hour mean ambulatory SBP of 130 mm Hg to 160 mm Hg were subsequently randomized (1:1) to additional blinded treatment to receive single subcutaneous doses of zilebesiran 600 mg or matching placebo. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point in each cohort was the difference between zilebesiran and placebo in change from baseline in 24-hour mean ambulatory SBP at 3 months. Results: Of 1491 patients entering the run-in phase, 663 (130 receiving indapamide, 240 receiving amlodipine, and 293 receiving olmesartan) were randomized to receive zilebesiran (n = 332) or placebo (n = 331).

However, postoperative morbidity often interferes with administration of systemic therapy and may be unacceptable to some patients. Ablative radiation therapy (A-RT) has emerged as an effective noninvasive local treatment in many tumor types and may provide an alternative to surgery in select patients with resectable PDAC. Objective: To estimate the efficacy of A-RT in technically resectable PDAC. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study of consecutive patients with histologically confirmed, radiographically resectable T1-2N0-1M0 PDAC treated with A-RT at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between June 2016 and December 2022 were included from a prospectively maintained database. Patients were not eligible for surgery because of noncancer-related comorbidities. Data were frozen for analysis in December 2023, which took place between March and November 2024. Exposures: All patients received A-RT exceeding 97.5-Gy biologically effective dose with daily computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging guidance, motion management, and daily or selective adaptation of the dose distribution. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Secondary outcomes included biochemical and radiographic objective response rate, cumulative incidence of local progression, progression-free survival, and distant metastasis-free survival. Results: Of 25 patients with radiographically resectable PDAC who received A-RT, 13 (52%) were male, and the median (IQR) age at time of A-RT was 80 (74-87) years. A total of 20 patients (80%) had a Karnofsky Performance Status score of 80 or lower. A total of 15 tumors (60%) were T2, and 4 (16%) were node positive. A total of 17 patients (68%) received induction chemotherapy for a median (range) of 2.9 (1.0-6.1) months. Radiation therapy regimens delivered with conventional linear accelerators included 75 Gy in 25 fractions among 13 patients, 67.5 Gy in 15 fractions among 9 patients, 50 Gy in 5 fractions among 2 patients (magnetic resonance imaging-guided linear accelerator), and 60 Gy in 10 for 1 patient. OS, local progression, and distant metastasis-free survival at 2 years were 43.7% (95% CI, 27.4%-69.5%), 20.8% (95% CI, 7.3%-39.0%), and 20.0% (95% CI, 9.1%-43.8%), respectively. Grade 3 acute and late gastrointestinal tract toxic effects were noted in 3 and 1 patients, respectively, with no grade 4 or higher events. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, A-RT in patients with technically resectable PDAC led to effective local tumor control and favorable OS despite advanced age, poor Karnofsky Performance Status score, and conservative use of chemotherapy in the cohort studied. These data support a prospective study of A-RT for the management of resectable PDAC.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Silvio""=>""Excluded"", ""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza DM,Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Tópico desalinhado | USER-NOTES: {""Silvio""=>[""Não identifiquei alinhamento com DM ou ML aplicada.""]}",10.1001/jamaoncol.2025.0460,adult;aged;article;cohort analysis;comorbidity;computer assisted tomography;data mining;distant metastasis free survival;drug therapy;female;gastrointestinal toxicity;human;induction chemotherapy;Karnofsky Performance Status;linear accelerator;long term survival;major clinical study;male;nuclear magnetic resonance imaging;overall survival;pancreas cancer;pancreatic ductal carcinoma;progression free survival;prospective study;radiation dose distribution;radiotherapy;special situation for pharmacovigilance;surgery;systemic therapy,,

Objective: To investigate the safety and effectiveness at 1 year of SPI + GSL + GT vs trabeculectomy in advanced primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) without cataract. Design, Setting, and Participants: This noninferiority randomized clinical trial was conducted at 8 tertiary eye centers in China. A total of 88 Chinese patients (88 eyes) with advanced PACG without cataract were enrolled from January 2022 to July 2023. Data were analyzed from August 2024 to September 2024. Mean (SD) patient age was 60.3 (7.3) years, and 52 patients (59.1%) were female. Forty-three patients were randomized to SPI + GSL + GT and 45 were randomized to trabeculectomy; 86 patients (97.7%) completed the 12-month follow-up. Interventions: Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive SPI + GSL + GT or trabeculectomy. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was IOP at 12 months (noninferior margin: 4 mm Hg). Secondary outcomes included surgical success (IOP: 5-18 mm Hg, ≥20% reduction from baseline, with or without antiglaucoma medications); postoperative complications and interventions, including bleb massage, suture lysis, or releasable sutures; and number of antiglaucomatous medications prescribed. Results: At 12 months, the SPI + GSL + GT group had a mean (SD) IOP of 15.6 (4.0) mm Hg vs 14.9 (4.2) mm Hg in the trabeculectomy group (difference, 0.5 mm Hg; 95% CI, -1.2 to 2.2; P =.55), which was within the 4-mm Hg noninferiority margin. Qualified success rates were 38 of 43 participants (88.4%) for SPI + GSL + GT and 42 of 45 participants (93.3%) for trabeculectomy (difference, -5.0%; 95% CI, -19.6% to 8.5%; P =.48). However, complete success rates were lower in the SPI + GSL + GT group (26 participants [60.5%]) vs the trabeculectomy group (37 participants [82.2%]; difference, -21.8%; 95% CI, -40.2% to -2.4%; P =.03). Postoperative complications were present for 8 participants (18.6%) in the SPI + GSL + GT group vs 9 participants (20.0%) in the trabeculectomy group (difference, -1.4%; 95% CI, -17.9% to 15.1%; P =.71). Postoperative interventions were lower in the SPI + GSL + GT group (3 participants [7.0%] vs 25 participants [55.6%]; difference, 48.6%; 95% CI, 32.2%-65.0%; P <.001). Median (IQR) numbers of medications used decreased from 2 (0-3) to 0 (0-1) in the SPI + GSL + GT group and from 2 (2-3) to 0 (0-0) in the trabeculectomy group (difference, -0.81; 95% CI, -1.36 to -0.26; P =.004). Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial among patients with advanced PACG without cataract, SPI + GSL + GT demonstrated noninferiority (4-mm Hg margin) to trabeculectomy for IOP at 12 months, with fewer interventions (including bleb massage, suture lysis, or releasable sutures) but no difference in postoperative medication use. This suggests SPI + GSL + GT as a potential alternative to trabeculectomy for similar cases, pending validation in larger sample sizes with smaller noninferiority margins.

However, limited clinical research and inconsistent results have hindered a comprehensive understanding of this issue. This study seeks to elucidate gender and age differences in cardiac-related adverse reactions, aiming to offer scientific evidence to inform clinical practice. Design A retrospective pharmacovigilance study. Setting Based on the reports of ICIs in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database from 2003-2023, we conducted a disproportionality analysis to identify cardiac immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and explored the correlation of age and gender with these adverse events. Main outcome measures The main cardiac irAEs were defined by four preferred terms: myocarditis, atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure and pericardial effusion. Both the proportional reporting ratio (PRR) and reporting odds ratio (ROR) are frequency methods. Data mining was performed using the PRR method, which assesses the relative risk of adverse drug reactions by comparing the frequency of reports associating a specific drug with a particular adverse reaction to the frequency of reports linking any drug to the same reaction. A higher PRR indicates a more robust adverse event signal, suggesting a stronger statistical association between the drug of interest and the target adverse event. In the research process, we primarily used the ROR and PRR from disproportionality analysis to screen for cardiac irAEs, while also elucidating the correlation between these reactions and factors such as age and gender. Results A total of 2033 adverse events were retrieved, and myocarditis was the most common cardiac irAEs. Gender disparities exist in the incidence of various adverse reactions to the same medication. Female patients need to be particularly vigilant for cardiac adverse events when taking atezolizumab, and male patients should be especially cautious for cardiac adverse events when using ipilimumab. Furthermore, ipilimumab produced a positive signal for pericardial effusion in the elderly group but not in the younger group, suggesting that elderly patients may be more susceptible to adverse reactions. Therefore, increased vigilance and careful monitoring are warranted during clinical administration of this medication to elderly patients. Conclusion Our study highlights the gender and age differences in cardiac adverse events with ICIs, providing valuable insights for clinical application.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Silvio""=>""Included"", ""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.1136/bmjopen-2024-090087,adolescent;adult;adverse drug reaction;age distribution;aged;article;atezolizumab;atrial fibrillation;avelumab;cardiotoxicity;cemiplimab;child;clinical outcome;cohort analysis;data mining;drug monitoring;durvalumab;female;Food and Drug Administration;heart failure;human;immune checkpoint inhibitor;immunopathology;infant;ipilimumab;major clinical study;male;myocarditis;newborn;nivolumab;pembrolizumab;pericardial effusion;pharmacovigilance;retrospective study;sex difference;signal detection,,

Our research objective was to evaluate the safety characteristics of TAF in practical settings by analyzing data from the FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS) database maintained by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Method In our investigation, we examined the uneven distribution of adverse events associated with TAF by employing statistical metrics including the Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), and Gamma-Poisson Shrinker (GPS) to determine their significance. Results Out of the 57692002 case reports in the FAERS database, 1911 reported TAF as a major suspected (PS) adverse events (AEs). A disproportionate analysis identified 43 preferred terms (PTs) related to TAF. It is worth noting that we have observed unexpected significant adverse events, such as cerebral infarction, bone pain, swallowing difficulties, drug resistance, dementia, etc., which are not mentioned in the drug instructions. Conclusion These findings unearth novel neurological, metabolic, and resistance - related risks, thereby necessitating a marked increase in clinical vigilance. The identification of signals related to cerebral infarction and dementia implies potential vascular/metabolic interplay, highlighting the importance of lipid monitoring among long - term tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) users. In response, healthcare providers should prioritize strengthening the monitoring of neurological symptoms and lipid profiles, reevaluating bone health assessment and management protocols especially in high - risk populations, and providing support to enhance patient adherence to mitigate resistance risks. This analysis offers crucial post - marketing evidence, which is instrumental in optimizing the risk - benefit balance of TAF in the long - term management of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: Y.

The AE reports related to brodalumab from the FAERS database from 2017 Q1 to 2023 Q4 were collected. Subsequently, we employed four disproportionality analysis methods to identify positive signals among AEs associated with brodalumab, including Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), and Multi-Item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS). In 1480 AE reports with brodalumab as the primary suspected drug, 168 preferred terms (PTs) exhibiting positive signals were identified. This study confirmed several known positive AEs, such as injection site vesicles and injection site hemorrhage. In addition, the study identified several positive AEs not listed in the drug product information, including palmoplantar pustulosis and extranodal marginal zone b-cell lymphoma (malt type). This study evaluated the real-world safety profile of brodalumab and identified several unexpected AEs, such as palmoplantar pustulosis and extranodal marginal zone b-cell lymphoma (malt type).

The scarcity of ADE named entity recognition (NER) datasets for social media hinders the development of robust ADE detection models for this type of corpus. In this paper, we leveraged the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to create synthetic data, addressing this dataset gap. Specifically, we generated 17,000 tweets with ADE annotations and pre-trained NER models on this synthetic data. Our evaluations on an out-of-sample collection of 915 manually annotated tweets revealed that these models outperform state-of-the-art lexico-based and massively pre-trained open NER models. We also show that fine-tuning our synthetically pre-trained models on human-annotated data surpasses the current state-of-the-art in ADE detection on tweets. These findings suggest that synthetic data generated by LLMs can enhance ADE detection performance, offering a promising avenue to explore in response to the scarcity of annotated ADE datasets.

Online forums such as Erowid provide valuable user insights, but analyses of these experiences using natural language processing (NLP) remain scarce. Objective: This study aims to utilize NLP, including sentiment and lexicon analysis, to examine user-generated experience reports on psilocybin-containing mushrooms and LSD from the Erowid forum. Methods: Data from 2188 Erowid users (1161 psilocybin mushrooms and 1027 LSD) was collected via automated web scraping with XPath, CSS selectors, and Selenium WebDriver. The dataset included report titles, substances, and demographics. Sentiment analysis utilized BERT, RoBERTa, and VADER models. Preprocessing involved tokenization, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, and stop-word filtering. Lexicon analysis identified themes through recurring n-grams, visualized using Python. Results: User demographics revealed comparable ages for psilocybin mushrooms (23.8 ± 0.9 years) and LSD users (20.0 ± 0.6 years), with a predominance of male users. The BERT model predominantly labeled experiences as negative (unfavorable), particularly for mushroom users (p = 0.001). VADER indicated more positive experiences for mushroom users (p < 0.001), while RoBERTa mainly classified experiences as negative or neutral. Significant gender differences were found only with VADER, where more male users expressed positive opinions about psilocybin mushrooms (74.09% versus 65.52%, p < 0.021). The VADER model yielded more polarized results, whereas RoBERTa’s cautious classifications indicate its suitability for analyzing lengthy and complex psychedelic reports. Further, RoBERTa outperformed other transformer-based models, achieving the highest accuracy. Lexicon analysis revealed emotional, sensory, and temporal themes, with psilocybin reports emphasizing introspection and time dilation phenomenon, while LSD reports highlighted memory issues and cognitive disorientation. Conclusions: Sentiment analysis showed that VADER produced more polarized results, while RoBERTa offered cautious classifications with the highest accuracy. Lexicon analysis revealed shared themes, with mushroom reports focusing on introspection and time dilation perception, while those of LSD emphasized cognitive disturbances. This study highlights the value of these analyses in understanding psychedelic experiences, informing harm reduction, and guiding policy-making.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Silvio""=>""Excluded"", ""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Dados de bases não oficiais",10.1007/s40264-025-01530-z,adult;article;book;cesium ion;cognitive defect;computer language;customer experience;demographics;depression;disorientation;drug administration route;effect size;experience;female;gender;harm reduction;human;hypothesis;introspection;lysergide;male;medical literature;mushroom;natural language processing;perception;personalized medicine;pharmacovigilance;psilocybine;psychedelic agent;search engine;selenium;sentiment analysis;sex difference;study;suicidal ideation,,

Medical management of CS is essential for controlling hypercortisolism as part of preoperative preparation for definitive surgical treatment and for managing residual or relapsed hypercortisolism post-surgery. Osilodrostat, a dual inhibitor of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid biosynthetic pathways, has been approved for the medical treatment of CS since early 2020. However, real-world data on its adverse effects remain limited. We mined the FAERS database and analyzed the reports associated with osilodrostat up to 1 October 2024. Methods: Descriptive and disproportionality methods based on Relative Odds Ratio (ROR), Chi-square (χ2), and Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), were used to discern potential safety signals and assess the significance of osilodrostat-associated adverse events. Results: This study identified 782 reports in which osilodrostat was the primary suspected drug, containing 593 preferred terms (PTs) and 2481 occurrences. The most frequently registered events belonged to the following SOCs: “General disorders and administration site conditions” (n = 457, 18.4%), “Injury, poisoning and procedural complications” (n = 311, 12.5%), “Gastrointestinal disorders” (n = 278, 11.2%), “Investigations” (n = 260, 10.5%), and “Nervous system disorders” (n = 184, 7.4%). Among PTs, off-label use was the most commonly reported, aligning with the fact that the vast majority of cases originated from the U.S. (84%), where osilodrostat is officially approved only for the treatment of CD. Disproportionality analysis confirmed previously known and new potential adverse drug reactions associated with osilodrostat treatment, including reports of cardiac flutter (n: 4; PRR: 19.42; χ2: 49.57), ventricular extrasystoles (n: 4; PRR: 11.85; χ2: 29.62), muscular weakness (n: 8; PRR: 2.25; χ2: 4.38), rib fracture (n: 4; PRR: 6.66; χ2: 13.99), spinal fracture (n: 3; PRR: 4.66; χ2: 5.35), sepsis (n: 9; PRR: 2.63; χ2: 7.56), fungal infections (n: 4; PRR: 3.67; χ2: 5.33), and COVID-19 (n: 32; PRR: 5.07; χ2: 101.16).

While existing deep learning methods show promise, they have yet to explore using heterogeneous networks to simultaneously model the various relationship between drugs and side effects, highlighting areas for potential enhancement. In this study, we propose DSE-HNGCN, a novel method that leverages heterogeneous networks to simultaneously model the various relationships between drugs and side effects. By employing multi-layer graph convolutional networks, we aim to mine the interactions between drugs and side effects to predict the frequencies of drug-side effects. To address the over-smoothing problem in graph convolutional networks and capture diverse semantic information from different layers, we introduce a layer importance combination strategy. Additionally, we have developed an integrated prediction module that effectively utilizes drug and side effect features from different networks. Our experimental results, using benchmark datasets in a range of scenarios, show that our model outperforms existing methods in predicting the frequencies of drug-side effects. Comparative experiments and visual analysis highlight the substantial benefits of incorporating heterogeneous networks and other pertinent modules, thus improving the accuracy of DSE-HNGCN predictions. We also provide interpretability for DSE-HNGCN, indicating that the extracted features are potentially biologically significant. Case studies validate our model's capability to identify potential side effects of drugs, offering valuable insights for subsequent biological validation experiments.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Naõ utiliza bases oficiais,Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Dados de bases não oficiais",10.1016/j.jmb.2024.168916,accuracy;adverse drug reaction;article;benchmarking;convolutional neural network;crystal structure;data mining;data processing;deep learning;disease association;drug development;drug safety;frequency;gene ontology;heterogeneous network;human;information;machine learning;multi layer graph convolutional network;noise;pharmacology;prediction;probability;risk benefit analysis;training,,

It is not known if incisional negative pressure wound therapy (iNPWT) can reduce SSI rates in this setting. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of iNPWT in reducing the rate of SSI in adults undergoing emergency laparotomy with primary skin closure. Design, Setting, and Participants: SUNRRISE was an assessor-masked, pragmatic, phase 3, individual-participant, randomized clinical trial. Adult patients undergoing emergency laparotomy in 22 hospitals in the UK and 12 hospitals in Australia between December 18, 2018, and May 25, 2021, were recruited. Patients were followed up for 30 days postprocedure; database closure was on August 25, 2021. Interventions: Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive iNPWT (n = 411), which involved a specialized dressing used to create negative pressure over the closed wound vs the surgeon's choice of wound dressing (n = 410). Randomization and dressing application occurred in the operating room at the end of the surgical procedure. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome measure was SSI up to 30 days postprocedure, evaluated by an assessor masked to the randomized allocation and using criteria from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There were 7 secondary outcomes, including length of hospital stay, postoperative complications up to 30 days, hospital readmission for wound-related complications within 30 days, wound pain, and quality of life. Results: A total of 840 patients were randomized (536 from the UK; 304 from Australia). Overall, 52% were female; the mean age was 63.8 (range, 18.8 to 95.3) years. After postrandomization exclusions (N = 52), 394 participants per group were included in the primary analysis. The number of participants who had an SSI in the iNPWT group was 112 of 394 (28.4%), compared with 108 of 394 (27.4%) in the surgeon's preference group (relative risk, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.83-1.28]; P =.78). This finding was consistent across the preplanned subgroup analyses, including degree of contamination, presence of a stoma, participant body mass index, and skin preparation used, and across all preplanned sensitivity analyses. Of 7 secondary outcomes, 6 showed no significant difference, including hospital readmission, quality of life, and hospital stay (median [IQR], 8 [6-14] days in the iNPWT group and 9 [6-14.5] days in the surgeon's preference group [ratio of geometric means, 0.96 (95% CI, 0.88-1.06); P =.21]).

Reference sets have been developed to evaluate the performance of the data-mining methods. However, reference sets generated in previous studies are not based on Japanese safety information; therefore, they are not suitable for use in evaluation studies in Japan because some drugs have not been approved or marketed for a long time in Japan. This study aimed to develop a reference set using drug safety information marketed in Japan and to evaluate its performance. Methods: A reference set was developed for 43 drugs and 15 events. For each combination of the selected drug and event, those that were listed as important identified risks in the Japan Risk Management Plan (J-RMP) were set as “positive controls” and those that were not listed as adverse reactions in the package insert were set as “negative controls.” In addition, we performed data-mining using Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database (JADER) and evaluated the results against the reference set to empirically confirm its effectiveness. Results: The reference set included 127 positive and 386 negative controls. A comparison of the signals obtained from data-mining using JADER with the reference set revealed higher correlations than those in previous studies.

Traditional deep learning models are adept at learning intricate feature representations and dependencies in sequential data, but often require extensive labeled data. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) excel in understanding contextual information, but exhibit unstable performance on named entity recognition (NER) tasks, possibly due to their broad but unspecific training. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs and traditional deep learning models in AE extraction, and to assess the impact of ensembling these models on performance. Methods: In this study, we utilized reports and posts from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) (n = 230), Twitter (n = 3,383), and Reddit (n = 49) as our corpora. Our goal was to extract three types of entities: vaccine, shot, and adverse event (ae). We explored and fine-tuned (except GPT-4) multiple LLMs, including GPT-2, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Llama-2 7b, and Llama-2 13b, as well as traditional deep learning models like Recurrent neural network (RNN) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining (BioBERT). To enhance performance, we created ensembles of the three models with the best performance. For evaluation, we used strict and relaxed F1 scores to evaluate the performance for each entity type, and micro-average F1 was used to assess the overall performance. Results: The ensemble demonstrated the best performance in identifying the entities “vaccine,” “shot,” and “ae,” achieving strict F1-scores of 0.878, 0.930, and 0.925, respectively, and a micro-average score of 0.903.

Therefore, predicting the possibility of their occurrence and taking early and effective response measures is of great significance. Constructing a correlation matrix between drugs and their adverse reactions, followed by effective correlation data mining, is one of the current strategies to predict ADRs using accessible public data. Since the number of known ADRs in real-world data is far less than the number of their unknown counterparts, the drug-ADR association matrix is very sparse, which greatly affects the classification performance of machine learning methods. To effectively address the problem of sparsity, we proposed a novel weighted pseudo-labeling framework that mines potential unknown drug-ADR pairs by integrating multiple weighted matrix factorization (MF) models and treating them as pseudo-labeled drug-ADR pairs. Pseudo-labeled data is added to the training set, and the MF model is fine-tuned to improve the classification performance. To prevent overfitting to easily found pseudo-labels and improve the quality of pseudo-labels, a novel weighting approach for pseudo-labels was adopted. This paper reproduces the baselines under the same experimental conditions to evaluate the performance of the proposed method on sparse data from the Side Effect Resource (SIDER) database. Experimental results showed that our method outperformed other baselines in the Area Under Precision-Recall and F1-scores and still maintained the best performance in sparser scenarios. Furthermore, we conducted a case study, and the results showed that our proposed framework efficiently predicted ADRs in the real world.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: F.

Methods: This study aimed to identify culprit drugs that reduced male semen quality based on the United States Food and Drug Administration adverse event reporting system. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities preferred terms and standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities queries were used to define reduced male semen quality. Adverse events related to drug-reduced male semen quality were then analyzed by disproportionality analysis using the United States Food and Drug Administration adverse event reporting system data between 2004 and 2023. Results: At the preferred term level, 59 drugs with risk signals were detected to be associated with drug-reduced male semen quality, with the three most frequently reported second-level Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical groups being antineoplastic agents (n = 16, 27.12%), psychoanaleptics (n = 9, 15.25%), and psycholeptics (n = 6, 10.17%). At the standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities queries level, the five drugs with the greatest number of cases were finasteride (845 cases, IC025 = 7.72), dutasteride (163 cases, IC025 = 7.22), tamsulosin (148 cases, IC025= 5.99), testosterone (101 cases, IC025= 4.08), and valproic acid (54 cases, IC025= 2.44). Additionally, clinical information about drug-reduced male semen quality is absent from the Summary of Product Characteristics of 41 drugs in our study. Conclusions: Using the United States Food and Drug Administration adverse event reporting system database, we offer a list of drugs with risk signals for reducing male semen quality. In the future, there is still a need for more studies on drugs whose effects on male semen quality are not fully understood.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.1111/andr.13668,adolescent;adult;allopurinol;anticonvulsive agent;antineoplastic agent;article;big data;carbamazepine;central stimulant agent;controlled study;cryopreservation;cyclosporine;data mining;dutasteride;dutasteride plus tamsulosin;fertility preservation;finasteride;Food and Drug Administration;human;immune checkpoint inhibitor;levetiracetam;male;Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities;monotherapy;nivolumab;pharmacovigilance;prescription insert;retrospective study;semen analysis;semen cryopreservation;semen parameters;sperm count;sperm quality;spermatogenesis;spermatogonium;spermatozoon density;tamsulosin;testis tissue;testosterone;valproic acid,,

We obtained reports of ICI-associated BP from the first quarter of 2011 to the first quarter of 2024 in the FAERS database. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) method of the disproportionality analysis was performed to assess the potential risk for ICI-associated BP. We also described the clinical characteristics of ICI-associated BP and evaluated the time to onset (TTO) of BP developed after treatment with ICIs. Eight hundred and six cases of ICI-associated BP were gathered, in which 56.58% of the patients were aged 65 years or older. The majority of patients were male, accounting for 68.49% of all cases. The prevalent potential cancer type was skin cancer (31.64%). The results of the disproportionality analysis showed that males (ROR = 2.10 [1.78–2.49]), patients aged 65 or older (ROR = 2.13 [1.79–2.55]), and patients with skin cancer (ROR = 2.08 [1.80–2.43]) were more likely to develop ICI-associated BP. In comparison to cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 inhibitor and programmed cell death ligand 1 inhibitor, programmed cell death 1 inhibitor-associated BP has a higher risk of development (ROR = 24.45 [22.52–26.56]). ICI-associated BP had a median TTO of 204 days (interquartile range 57–426 days). ICI-associated BP is a rare but important immune-related adverse event.

In this work, we investigate a computational approach using data mining tools to detect safety signals from post-market safety databases, or in other words, to identify adverse events (AEs) with disproportionately high reporting rates compared to other AEs, associated with a particular drug or a drug class. Essentially, we view this as a problem of cluster analysis-based anomaly detection on post-market safety data, where the goal is to ‘unsupervisedly’ detect the anomalous or the signal AEs. Our findings demonstrate the potential of using a clustering ensemble method to detect drug safety signals. It employs multiple clustering or anomaly detection algorithms, followed by a performance comparison of the candidate algorithms based on a collection of appropriate measures of goodness of clustering results. The method is general enough to include any number of clustering or anomaly detection algorithms and goodness measures, and performs better than any of the candidate algorithms in identifying the signal AEs. Extensive simulation studies illustrate that the ensemble method detects the AE signals from synthetic post-market safety datasets pretty accurately across the different scenarios explored. Based on the cases reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) between 2013 and 2022, we further demonstrate that the ensemble method successfully identifies and confirms most of the adverse events that are known to occur most frequently in reaction to antiepileptic drugs and β-lactam antibiotics.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Silvio""=>""Maybe"", ""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Desenvolvimento do método,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.1007/s43441-024-00705-7,acute kidney failure;amoxicillin;anticonvulsive agent;anxiety disorder;article;beta lactam antibiotic;brivaracetam;cefalexin;ceftriaxone;cefuroxime;chronic kidney failure;clonazepam;cluster analysis;clustering algorithm;computer analysis;controlled study;data mining;decreased appetite;depression;detection algorithm;diarrhea;dizziness;drug classification;drug database;drug fever;drug hypersensitivity;drug overdose;drug safety;dyspnea;falling;fatigue;fenfluramine;fever;Food and Drug Administration;headache;human;kidney disease;kidney failure;lamotrigine;liver disease;lorazepam;meropenem;nausea;outlier detection;pain;pharmacovigilance;postmarketing surveillance;primidone;pseudomembranous colitis;rash;seizure;side effect;simulation;somnolence;tremor;vomiting,,

However, their real-world safety profile in a large sample population is incomplete. Objectives: We aimed to provide a pharmacovigilance study of the adverse events (AEs) associated with gilteritinib and midostaurin through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. Design: A retrospective analysis of the FAERS database was conducted by disproportionality analyses. Methods: We conducted disproportionality analyses to identify drug-AE associations, including the reporting odds ratio and the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network. A signal was detected if both methods achieved statistical significance. Results: There were 1887 and 2091 case reports for gilteritinib and midostaurin, respectively. We have separately retained significant disproportionality AEs across two algorithms, with a total of 53 AEs for gilteritinib and 46 for midostaurin. The common AEs observed with gilteritinib included febrile neutropenia, pyrexia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Similarly, the prevalent AEs associated with midostaurin were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, pyrexia, and febrile neutropenia. The common AEs of both drugs are consistent with previous clinical trials. Notably, we also revealed unexpected significant AEs for both drugs. For gilteritinib, 29 positive signals for AEs not mentioned in its instructions were identified, such as cerebral hemorrhage, tumor lysis syndrome, and interstitial lung disease. Midostaurin exhibited 24 positive signals for AEs not listed in its instructions, including neutropenic colitis, neutropenic sepsis, and septic shock. Conclusion: This study highlights the need for continued monitoring and evaluation of these drugs in clinical practice, as it first reveals their AEs in a large real-world sample population. Some AEs are generally consistent with the instructions and previous studies, but some unexpected AEs are detected for each drug. Due to the limitations of the spontaneous report database, such as including potential underreporting, overreporting, lack of causal relationship, unable to calculate incidence, and other confounding factors, more pharmacoepidemiology studies are needed to validate our findings.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: Y.

Methods: Using the Open Vigil 2.1 online tool, extract adverse drug event (ADE) report data for voriconazole, posaconazole, and isavuconazole from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database from the time the drugs were marketed up to the third quarter of 2023. Employ the Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) and Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) methods for data mining. Filter out ADE signals detected by both the ROR and PRR methods, and categorize these ADE signals by System Organ Class (SOC) according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA 26.0). Results: A total of 8,898 ADE reports with voriconazole as the primary suspect drug were retrieved, 1,948 for posaconazole, and 944 for isavuconazole. From the basic analysis of the adverse event reports, male patients (50.31%) outnumber female patients (32.11%). In terms of age, the majority of patients are over 45 years old (52.72%). The reports primarily come from the United States, Japan, France, China, and other countries. A total of 607 ADE signals were identified, with 402 for voriconazole, 159 for posaconazole, and 46 for isavuconazole. Voriconazole ADEs primarily involved the following SOCs: Investigations (9.45%), Eye Disorders (8.46%), and Nervous System Disorders (7.21%); Posaconazole ADEs primarily involved the following SOCs: Investigations (13.84%), General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (11.95%), and Nervous System Disorders (6.29%); Isavuconazole ADEs primarily involved the following SOCs: General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (15.22%), Hepatobiliary Disorders (10.87%), and Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders (10.87%). Conclusion: Voriconazole, posaconazole, and isavuconazole all potentially pose safety risks related to hepatobiliary disorders and cardiac disorders. Additionally, voriconazole carries a higher safety risk for eye disorders and nervous system disorders. Newly discovered ADE signals not mentioned in the drug package inserts include voriconazole-induced rhabdomyolysis, posaconazole-induced peripheral neuropathy, and isavuconazole-induced visual impairment and mental confusion. These findings are significant for guiding rational clinical use of these medications.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: H.

rayyan-281079757,Data mining and safety analysis of voriconazole in patients with a hematological malignant tumor based on the FAERS database: differences between children and adults,2025,,,Frontiers in Pharmacology,1663-9812,16,,,"Li, H. and Jiang, M. and Pan, X. and Kong, L.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2033101391&from=export,English,,,"Objective: Voriconazole is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent. It is used widely for the prevention and treatment of invasive fungal infections in patients with a hematological malignancy, but studies on its safety in this population are scarce. We assessed the adverse drug events (ADEs) of voriconazole in this population based on the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database to improve understanding of the safety of voriconazole. Research design and methods: ADE reports for patients with a hematological malignant tumor using voriconazole between the first quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2024 were retrieved. Then, they were classified using the preferred terminology (PT) and system organ category (SOC) in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Data mining was done using reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), and multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS). Results: A total of 605 ADEs were included: 116 (19.17%) in children and 489 (80.83%) in adults. The types of SOC involved in children and adults were 22 and 24, respectively. The only positive SOC signal that satisfied all four algorithms simultaneously in children was “psychiatric disorders”, whereas in adults they were “endocrine disorders” and “hepatobiliary disorders”. At the PT level, the types involved in children and adults were 28 and 74, respectively. The highest ROR signal intensities were found for “hallucinations, mixed” in children and “toxic optic neuropathy” in adults. The median time of onset of the ADE in children and adults was 11 and 8.5 days, respectively. Conclusion: We used four algorithms (ROR, PRR, BCPNN, MGPS) to mine the signals of voriconazole in patients with a hematological malignant tumor, and compared the differences between children and adults. This study is important for targeting the monitoring, and could help to improve the safety of voriconazole.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: L.

The safety of apremilast in elderly patients has not been adequately explored in clinical trials. This study was to evaluate the safety profile of apremilast in young and middle-aged patients and elderly patients separately, through data mining of the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Methods: Reports in the FAERS from the third quarter of 2014 to the second quarter of 2023 were collected and analyzed. Disproportionality analyses (the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), and the multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS) algorithms) were employed to quantify the ADE signals of apremilast in the age groups of 18–65 years and over 65 years. Results: After data cleaning, a total of 54,926 and 14,156 ADE reports were retrieved, with 66 and 61 ADE signals identified in young and middle-aged patients and in elderly patients, respectively. Several unexpected ADE signals not listed in the drug labeling information were detected, including pericarditis, increased cholesterol levels, liver injury, postoperative thrombosis, serum calcium, and parathyroid abnormalities. Furthermore, weight loss, psychiatric abnormalities, and infections in particular sites (ear, bursa mucosa, and central nervous system) were more significant in elderly patients. Conclusions: The study indicated several unexpected ADEs through disproportionality analysis and highlighted unique safety features in the elderly group. These findings may assist clinicians in managing psoriasis with apremilast.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Silvio""=>""Maybe"", ""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.1155/dth/8851158,abdominal discomfort;abdominal pain;adult;adverse event;aged;alanine aminotransferase;alertness;algorithm;allergy;apremilast;article;back propagation neural network;basal cell carcinoma;body weight loss;Bowen disease;calcium blood level;central nervous system;cholesterol blood level;cholesterol level;cyst;data base;data mining;deep vein thrombosis;defecation urgency;depression;diarrhea;drug labeling;drug safety;dry lip;dynamic Bayesian network;ear;ear disease;ear infection;enteropathy;female;folliculitis;Food and Drug Administration;frequent bowel movement;gastrointestinal disease;groups by age;headache;Helicobacter infection;human;hypercalcemia;hypercholesterolemia;infestation;information;insomnia;intestine polyp;irritable colon;laryngitis;lip;lip disease;liver injury;major clinical study;male;mental disease;middle aged;middle ear efusion;migraine;mood;mucosa;myasthenia gravis;nausea;neoplasm;nerve cell network;odds ratio;opportunistic infection;parathyroid disease;parathyroid gland;parathyroid hormone;pericarditis;peripheral vein;physiological stress;polyp;postoperative complication;postoperative thrombosis;pseudolymphoma;psoriasis;reporting and data system;side effect;sinus headache;skin papilloma;sleep disorder;soft stool;stomach disease;synovial bursa;tension headache;thyroxine;upper respiratory tract infection;vein disease;wound infection;young adult,,

However, their safety profiles remain unclear due to limited real-world evidence. This study aims to analyze and compare adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of these drugs using data from the WHO-VigiAccess and FAERS databases. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted using ADR data from the VigiAccess and FAERS databases, focusing on System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) classifications. Descriptive statistics and reporting odds ratio (ROR) analysis were employed to evaluate and compare ADR profiles. Results: Lecanemab and Aducanumab exhibited distinct ADRs. Results from both the VigiAccess and FAERS databases indicated that the most SOC associated with both drugs was nervous system disorders (34.7% in VigiAccess, 36.8% in FAERS). Further multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that Aducanumab was associated with a higher risk of nervous system disorders (OR = 4.72, 95% CI: 3.53–6.39, P < 0.001). Among the reported AEs, headache was the most frequently reported for Lecanemab (9.4% in VigiAccess, 8.96% in FAERS), while Aducanumab was primarily associated with amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) (19.1% in VigiAccess, 23.58% in FAERS). In the blood and lymphatic systems, Anemia was observed in both drugs. However, thrombocyto-penia was more prevalent in Lecanemab, while platelet dysfunction and myelosuppression were more frequently observed in Aducanumab. Additionally, hospitalization and mortality rates were higher for Aducanumab compared to Lecanemab. Conclusion: This study compared the ADRs of Lecanemab and Aducanumab, revealing that ARIA was the most common AE for both drugs. However, Lecanemab showed a lower risk of ARIA, cerebral hemorrhage, and severe events. These findings emphasize the need for further clinical research to clarify the long-term safety and efficacy of both drugs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Silvio""=>""Included"", ""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.3389/fphar.2025.1561020,aducanumab;adverse drug reaction;adverse event;aged;Alzheimer disease;article;atrial fibrillation;cognitive defect;data analysis software;data base;data mining;diarrhea;dizziness;donanemab;drug efficacy;drug safety;edema;FAERS database;fatigue;female;fever;follow up;Food and Drug Administration;gastrointestinal disease;head injury;headache;human;incidence;lecanemab;major clinical study;male;nausea;neurologic disease;outcome assessment;pain;pruritus;quality control;quantitative analysis;R version 4.4;retrospective study;risk assessment;somnolence;tremor;urinary tract disease;vomiting;WHO VigiAccess database,,

Methods: The study included data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) spanning from the first quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2024. We employed the disproportional analysis approach to analyze the signals of thrombosis-related adverse events associated with TNF-α blockers. Moreover, subgroup analyses were conducted to investigate the circumstances of different age and gender groups. Additionally, the induction time and Weibull distribution were utilized for the further interpretation of the data. Results: During the study period, among 1,382,627 patients in the FAERS database who had adverse events linked to TNF-α inhibitors, 9,714 could be attributed to thrombosis-related adverse events. In the remaining patients, different types of infection events accounted for a large proportion of the proportion. (N = 165,765) Thrombosis-related adverse event signals were detected in all five types of TNF-α inhibitor drugs. Among them, in the analysis of adalimumab, the adverse event signal of postpartum thrombosis was the strongest, and the positive signal of axillary vein thrombosis was the weakest. The analysis based on gender subgroups discovered some positive signals of adverse events that were not observed in the overall population. The Weibull distribution analysis indicated that all five drugs exhibited an premature aging type characteristic, and their induction decreased gradually over time. Conclusion: This study suggests that TNF - α blockers are associated with various adverse events of thrombosis, with different risks in different patient groups and treatment stages. Clinical doctors should assess individual thrombosis risk and closely monitor coagulation related indicators when using TNF - α inhibitors. This study offers valuable insights for optimizing treatment and improving safety.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Silvio""=>""Included"", ""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.3389/fphar.2025.1512806,adalimumab;adult;adverse event;aged;artery thrombosis;article;Bayesian network;brachiocephalic vein thrombosis;carotid artery thrombosis;cerebral sinus thrombosis;cerebral thrombosis;certolizumab pegol;data analysis software;data base;data mining;deep vein thrombosis;drug safety;etanercept;FAERS database;female;geometry;golimumab;hepatic vascular thrombosis;human;incidence;infliximab;injection site thrombosis;intracardiac thrombus;lateral sinus thrombosis;male;pelvic venous thrombosis;peripheral artery thrombosis;pharmacovigilance;portal vein thrombosis;postoperative thrombosis;pulmonary artery thrombosis;pulmonary thrombosis;R 4.4.1;superficial thrombophlebitis;thrombophlebitis;thrombosis;thrombotic adverse event;thrombus;treatment outcome;tumor necrosis factor inhibitor;upper extremity deep vein thrombosis;vein thrombosis,,

However, its neurological safety and tolerability in a large population remain limited. This study aimed to assess the neurological safety and potential risks of baclofen in the real world. Methods: Data covering the period from the first quarter of 2004 to the third quarter of 2024 were collected from the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Four disproportionality analysis methods were employed: the Reporting Odds Ratio, the Proportional Reporting Ratio, Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network, and the Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinkage (MGPS). These methods were used to detect and evaluate adverse events Adverse drug events associated with baclofen. Additionally, the time to onset analysis was conducted. Results: A total of 432 neurological-related preferred terms (PTs) were identified. The number of PT that were positive for all four algorithms was 40, and the top 5 PT were Hypotonia, Encephalopathy, Coma, Unresponsive to stimuli, and Cerebrospinal fluid leakage. The top 5 PTs for ROR values are Intracranial hypotension [ROR 66.24 (55.45–79.13)], Cerebrospinal fluid leakage [ROR 51.34 (45.84–57.51)], Autonomic dysreflexia [ROR 47.4 (32.27–69.63)], Basal ganglion degeneration [ROR 33.03 (18.54–58.84)], Sciatic nerve palsy [ROR 21.6 (11.14–41.87)]. The median onset time for baclofen -related ADEs was 27 days. Most cases (n = 241, 55.5%) occurred within the first month of baclofen administration. In an analysis of severe vs. non-severe ADEs, the study found that the incidence of severe cases was higher than that of non-severe cases, with no gender-related differences observed. Conclusion: This study identified clinically significant PTs using four different algorithms and performed gender subgroup analysis. The TTO analysis indicated that the onset of most ADEs occurred within 27 days. Furthermore, the frequency of severe ADEs was higher than that of non-severe ones. Clinicians should closely monitor for neurological adverse effects caused by baclofen, particularly severe ADEs, and consider individualized dosing strategies. Further research based on real-world data is needed to validate these findings.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Silvio""=>""Included"", ""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.3389/fphar.2025.1569602,adult;adverse event;aged;alcoholism;arachnoiditis;areflexia;article;autonomic dysreflexia;baclofen;bayesian confidence propagation neural network;brain toxicity;coma;data analysis software;data mining;demographics;disability;drug safety;drug tolerability;female;Food and Drug Administration;health care personnel;hospitalization;human;hyporeflexia;hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy;intracranial hypotension;liquorrhea;major clinical study;male;metabolic encephalopathy;multi item gamma poisson shrinkage;muscle hypotonia;muscle relaxant agent;muscle spasm;opisthotonus;patient safety;proportional reporting ratio;radicular pain;sciatic nerve palsy;sciatic neuropathy;sciatica,,

This study characterises age-stratified safety profiles of azithromycin using pharmacovigilance data. Methods: Adverse event (AE) reports for azithromycin prescribed in Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia treatment (2004–2024) were extracted from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Disproportionality analyses (Reporting Odds Ratio, Proportional Reporting Ratio, Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network, Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinker) identified safety signals across four age groups: 0–17, 18–44, 45–64, and ≥65 years. Results: Among 7,496 AE reports, age-specific risks varied significantly. Paediatric populations (0–17 years) exhibited predominant cutaneous/hypersensitivity reactions (rash, pruritus, Stevens-Johnson syndrome) and unlabelled psychiatric signals (hallucinations). Adults (18–44 years) showed pregnancy-related risks (preterm delivery). Geriatric patients (≥65 years) had heightened cardiac risks (QT prolongation, torsades de pointes), often exacerbated by off-label COVID-19 use. The 45–64-year cohort displayed the highest signal frequency, primarily involving drug hypersensitivity. Off-label prescribing accounted for 65% of geriatric AEs. Conclusion: Azithromycin safety profiles differ markedly across age groups. Children face dermatologic and neuropsychiatric risks, while elderly patients are vulnerable to cardiac complications. Strict adherence to labelled indications, age-specific monitoring, and avoidance of off-label use–particularly during public health crises–are critical to mitigating ADRs. These findings underscore the need for stratified clinical decision-making and targeted pharmacovigilance.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Silvio""=>""Excluded"", ""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.1080/20523211.2025.2525356,adult;adverse drug reaction;age;aged;article;azithromycin;child;clinical decision making;coronavirus disease 2019;data base;data mining;drug hypersensitivity;drug therapy;female;Food and Drug Administration;geriatric patient;groups by age;hallucination;human;macrolide;major clinical study;male;Mycoplasma pneumonia;nerve cell network;off label drug use;pharmacovigilance;pregnancy;premature labor;pruritus;QT prolongation;rash;side effect;signal detection;special situation for pharmacovigilance;Stevens Johnson syndrome;torsade de pointes,,

Methods: The FAERS database was queried, data from Q1 of 2004 to Q2 of 2023 were extracted, and AE reports targeting 5 ICMs as the primary suspects were collected. Data mining and analysis were carried out on relevant reports using the reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), and empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM), while the standardized medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) queries (SMQ) was used for systematic classification. Results: A total of 11,155,106 AE reports were retrieved from FAERS, with 2,412 for ioversol, 2,001 for iohexol, 987 for iodixanol, 1,154 for iopamidol, and 3,835 for iopromide. ICM-induced AE occurrence targeted 21 system organ classes (SOCs). A total of 329 significant disproportionality Preferred terms (PTs) conforming to the 4 algorithms were simultaneously retained. The results revealed that the medium and strong adverse drug reaction (ADR) signals of the 5 ICMs largely focused on “respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders,” “general disorders and administration site conditions,” “immune system disorders,” and “skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.” Ioversol (log2ROR = 1.21, Padj = 0.034) and iopromide (log2ROR = 1.32, Padj = 0.004) were both correlated with a higher incidence of a significant ADR signal, namely throat irritation, particularly in females. In addition, ioversol and iopromide also suggested that toxic nephropathy (log2ROR = −2.47, Padj < 0.001) and hyperhidrosis (log2ROR = −1.22, Padj = 0.001) were significant ADR signals, especially in males, respectively. Conclusions: While the AE distribution of the 5 ICMs was consistent, there were variations in specific ADR signal characteristics, warranting further consideration and exploration.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Silvio""=>""Included"", ""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.1016/j.clinthera.2024.11.007,adult;adverse drug reaction;aged;anaphylactoid reaction;anaphylaxis;article;bayesian confidence propagation neural network;brain disease;contrast medium extravasation;controlled study;cross validation;data analysis;data base;data mining;drug hypersensitivity;empirical bayes geometric mean;erythema;female;Food and Drug Administration;heart arrest;hospitalization;human;hyperhidrosis;hypotension;iodixanol;iohexol;iopamidol;iopromide;ioversol;major clinical study;male;Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities;nephrotoxicity;pharyngeal edema;proportional reporting ratio;reporting odds ratio;respiratory arrest;shock;side effect;sneezing;statistical parameters;throat irritation;urticaria,,

Consequently, the diagnostic criteria for adults still derives from studies conducted in the pediatric population. Several genetic mutations and secondary causes, including infections, autoimmunity, and malignancy, have been reported as significant actors in this condition, especially in adults. It is of the utmost importance to identify these triggers, as the treatment of this condition is largely dependent on addressing the underlying cause. Those who have undergone transplantation and whose immune response is already compromised are particularly susceptible to this condition. We present the case of a 74-year-old kidney transplant recipient who was admitted due to a persistent fever of unknown origin, pancytopenia, and splenomegaly. The patient was ultimately diagnosed with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in our hospital secondary to Epstein–Barr virus, aspergillosis, and leishmania infections. Targeted treatments for the aforementioned conditions led to the resolution of the syndrome and the recovery of the patient. Lymphohistiocytosis is a rare, albeit serious, condition that should be considered a differential diagnosis in the early stages of critical illness in transplant recipient patients. Doing so enables target treatments to be administered as soon as possible.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Silvio""=>""Excluded"", ""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza DM,Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Relato de caso",10.1016/j.transproceed.2024.12.012,abdominal pain;acute kidney failure;aged;amphotericin B;article;aspergillosis;autoimmunity;calcitonin;case report;cell activity;clinical article;computer assisted tomography;critical illness;Cytomegalovirus;daptomycin;data mining;differential diagnosis;drug therapy;Epstein Barr virus;estimated glomerular filtration rate;fatigue;ferritin;fever;gene mutation;graft recipient;hemophagocytic syndrome;human;hypertriglyceridemia;immune deficiency;immune response;immunosuppressive treatment;intensive care unit;kidney graft;kidney transplantation;lamivudine;leishmaniasis;meropenem;methylprednisolone;molecular diagnosis;mortality;mortality rate;multiple organ failure;mycophenolic acid;natural killer cell;pancytopenia;platelet count;polymerase chain reaction;prednisone;prophylaxis;pyrexia idiopathica;recipient;risk factor;rituximab;sepsis;septic shock;special situation for pharmacovigilance;splenomegaly;tacrolimus;thrombocytopenia;training;triacylglycerol;urinary tract infection,,

Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a major risk factor for TdP development, but the specific drug combinations that increase this risk have not been extensively studied. Objective: This study aims to identify clinically significant, high-priority DDIs to provide a foundation to minimize the risk of TdP and effectively manage DDI risks in the future. Methods: We used the following 4 frequency statistical models to detect DDI signals using the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database: Ω shrinkage measure, combination risk ratio, chi-square statistic, and additive model. The adverse event of interest was TdP, and the drugs targeted were all registered and classified as “suspect,” “interacting,” or “concomitant drugs” in FAERS. The DDI signals were identified and evaluated using the Lexicomp and Drugs.com databases, supplemented with real-world data from the literature. Results: As of September 2023, this study included 4313 TdP cases, with 721 drugs and 4230 drug combinations that were reported for at least 3 cases. The Ω shrinkage measure model demonstrated the most conservative signal detection, whereas the chi-square statistic model exhibited the closest similarity in signal detection tendency to the Ω shrinkage measure model. The κ value was 0.972 (95% CI 0.942-1.002), and the Ppositive and Pnegative values were 0.987 and 0.985, respectively. We detected 2158 combinations using the 4 frequency statistical models, of which 241 combinations were indexed by Drugs.com or Lexicomp and 105 were indexed by both. The most commonly interacting drugs were amiodarone, citalopram, quetiapine, ondansetron, ciprofloxacin, methadone, escitalopram, sotalol, and voriconazole. The most common combinations were citalopram and quetiapine, amiodarone and ciprofloxacin, amiodarone and escitalopram, amiodarone and fluoxetine, ciprofloxacin and sotalol, and amiodarone and citalopram. Although 38 DDIs were indexed by Drugs.com and Lexicomp, they were not detected by any of the 4 models. Conclusions: Clinical evidence on DDIs is limited, and not all combinations of heart rate–corrected QT interval (QTc)–prolonging drugs result in TdP, even when involving high-risk drugs or those with known risk of TdP. This study provides a comprehensive real-world overview of drug-induced TdP, delimiting both clinically significant DDIs and negative DDIs, providing valuable insights into the safety profiles of various drugs, and informing the optimization of clinical practice.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Silvio""=>""Excluded"", ""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.2196/65872,adolescent;adult;adverse drug reaction;aged;amiodarone;article;atrial fibrillation;bisoprolol;cardiopulmonary insufficiency;child;chlorpromazine;cimetidine;ciprofloxacin;cisapride;citalopram;clinical decision making;data mining;dizziness;dronedarone;drug;drug combination;drug interaction;escitalopram;faintness;false positive result;female;fluconazole;fluoxetine;fluphenazine;Food and Drug Administration;furosemide;halofantrine;haloperidol;heart arrest;heart arrhythmia;heart palpitation;heart ventricle arrhythmia;heart ventricle extrasystole;heart ventricle fibrillation;heart ventricle tachycardia;hospitalization;human;ibutilide;infant;long QT syndrome;loperamide;lorazepam;major clinical study;male;methadone;metoprolol;moxifloxacin;newborn;observational study;omeprazole;ondansetron;pharmacovigilance;procainamide;QTc interval;quetiapine;retrospective study;ritonavir;signal detection;sotalol;torsade de pointes;unconsciousness;very elderly;voriconazole,,

However, no work has focused on child passengers. The objective of this study was to compare crash scene and hospital-reported injury information for crash-involved child passengers. This study also explored injury location and severity by child age and restraint type. Methods: Utilizing linked New Jersey data from 2017 through 2019, the authors identified crash-involved child passengers <13 years old and their injuries in crash and hospital reports. Then, they characterized the congruency of injury frequency, severity, and location, as well as the frequency of injuries by child age and restraint type. Analyses were conducted from December 2023 through February 2024. Results: Of 84,060 crash-involved child passengers, crash reports documented 7,858 (9%) children with at least “possible” injuries, while 2,577 (3%) had at least one injury in hospital events. Crash report and hospital data were incongruent for both body region of injury and injury severity. The proportion of children injured increased as children's ages increased and as restraint type progressed. Conclusions: Crash reports overestimated the number of injured child passengers and misrepresented injury severity and locations. Child restraint systems mitigated a child's injury risk. Importantly, injury information documented on crash reports currently informs the allocation of traffic safety resources. These results highlight the importance of improving these reports’ accuracy and underscore calls to link administrative datasets for public health efforts.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Silvio""=>""Excluded"", ""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza DM,Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Tópico desalinhado",10.1016/j.amepre.2024.07.008,abdominal injury;article;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;body mass;child;child passenger safety;cohort analysis;computer assisted tomography;data mining;disease severity;DNA damage;emergency ward;gunshot injury;head injury;hospital infection;human;ICD-10-CM;injury;injury scale;injury severity;major clinical study;medical record;Melissa officinalis;New Jersey;public health;retrospective study;SAS 9.4;scoring system;special situation for pharmacovigilance;thorax injury;traffic accident;traffic safety;training;virus detection,,

Design: Retrospective cohort study. Methods: A total of 107 early NTG eyes of 88 patients, who underwent pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurements and optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography (OCT-A) at baseline, were categorized depending on the presence of peripapillary choroidal microvasculature dropout (MvD) and PWV. Differences in glaucomatous progression were analyzed. Structural progression rates were determined using the trend-based analysis of Cirrus OCT. Results: Thirty-two eyes displayed choroidal MvD (62.7 [95% CI 58.4-67.0] years old, 53.6% males), and 70 eyes did not show any MvD (59.9 (95% CI 57.1-62.6) years old, 53.3% males) at baseline. Patients were followed for 48.4 (95% CI 40.0-56.8) months. When they were further divided based on PWV (high PWV ≥ 1400 cm/sec), those with choroidal MvD and high PWV showed significantly faster thinning in macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL; P = .023). In comparison to those with low PWV and no MvD, eyes with high PWV and MvD in the peripapillary area were likely to show fast structural progression (≤-1.2 µm/year) in the macular GCIPL by odds of 6.019 (95% CI 1.619-38.531, P = .025). Conclusions: In NTG eyes, GCIPL thinning was faster when choroidal MvD and high systemic arterial stiffness were present. The simultaneous presence of regional and systemic vascular insufficiency may be associated with rapid glaucoma structural progression in eyes with low baseline intraocular pressure.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Silvio""=>""Excluded"", ""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza DM,Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Tópico desalinhado",10.1016/j.ajo.2024.06.029,adult;algorithm;angiography;AngioPlex;aortic stenosis;arterial stiffness;arteriosclerosis;article;best corrected visual acuity;beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent;body mass;brimonidine;central corneal thickness;chi square test;choroid;choroidal thickness;chronic kidney failure;cohort analysis;confidence interval;corneal thickness;creatinine;data analysis software;data mining;diabetes mellitus;diabetic retinopathy;diastolic blood pressure;digoxin;entecavir;ethambutol;female;Forum Glaucoma Workplace software;glaucoma;glucose blood level;gonioscopy;Haag-Streit model BQ-900;hemodialysis;human;Humphrey Field Analyzer II;Humphrey perimeter;hypertension;image analysis;image quality;interrater reliability;intraocular pressure;linear regression analysis;low tension glaucoma;major clinical study;male;microangiopathy;microvasculature;middle aged;nerve fiber;neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody;normal distribution;open angle glaucoma;ophthalmoscopy;optic disk;optic neuritis;optical coherence tomography;optical coherence tomography angiography device;perimetry;plethysmography;prevalence;prospective study;protocol;pseudoexfoliation;pulse wave;pulse wave velocity;ranibizumab;rank sum test;refraction error;regression analysis;retina blood vessel;retina blood vessel occlusion;retina detachment;retina ganglion cell;retina vein occlusion;retinal nerve fiber layer thickness;retinal outer plexiform layer;retinal pigment epithelium;retinal thickness;retrospective study;risk factor;secondary glaucoma;special situation for pharmacovigilance;spectral domain optical coherence tomography;SPSS version 23;statistical analysis;statistically significant result;statistics;systolic blood pressure;training;univariate analysis;uric acid;vigabatrin;visual acuity;VP-1000 plus,,

The MILES trial showed the efficacy of sirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, in stabilising lung function in patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Drug toxicity and development of resistance are potential limitations of therapy with sirolimus. Nintedanib is a multikinase inhibitor that inhibits PDGFR, which is active in human and murine lymphangioleiomyomatosis lesions. We aimed to investigate the activity and safety of nintedanib in patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Methods: This phase 2, open-label, single-arm study was conducted at MultiMedica IRCCS, a national referral university centre for rare pulmonary diseases in Milan, Italy. Eligible participants were aged 18 years and older and had sporadic or tuberous sclerosis complex-associated lymphangioleiomyomatosis with progressive pulmonary function decline in the past year despite treatment with sirolimus or treatment naive. Patients received nintedanib 150 mg orally twice per day, with a possible reduction to 100 mg twice per day in case of side-effects or hepatoxicity, for 12 months, followed by a period of 12 additional months without study treatment. The primary endpoint was the change in FEV1 (FEV1 slope in L) over 12 months. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03062943. Findings: From Oct 14, 2016, to Dec 13, 2019, 35 female patients (mean age 50 years [SD 11]) entered the study, 30 of whom were eligible and received nintedanib. After 12 months, 22 patients completed the treatment, 19 of whom also completed the 12 months of follow-up. FEV1 remained stable after one year of treatment (predicted mean difference 0·001 L [95% CI –0·063 to 0·066]; p=0·97). During the 12 months off treatment, a slight decline in FEV1 was observed (predicted mean difference –0·076 L [95% CI –0·149 to –0·004]; p=0·040). The most frequent adverse events were nausea (15 [50%] patients), diarrhoea (eight [26%]), and abdominal pain (two [7%]). No serious adverse events were observed during the treatment period. Interpretation: Our findings suggest that nintedanib did not improve FEV1, but that the treatment was generally well tolerated. These results might support nintedanib as a second-line therapy in patients not controlled by standard treatment with mTOR inhibitors. Further investigation, such as a non-inferiority trial comparing nintedanib and sirolimus could help to better clarify the role of this drug as a potential alternative treatment.

However, there is little research about its medication safety. Based on the FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS) database, this study aims to mine the adverse reaction signals of the latest major recommended drug Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir for the antiviral treatment of COVID-19, so as to provide a basis for safe and rational drug use. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) was used to explore the adverse event report data of all COVID-19 emergency use authorization (EUA) products in the FAERS database with the deadline of third quarter of 2023. In the analysis, 135427 adverse drug event (ADE) reports were found, and 35250 ADEs were reported with Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir as the primary suspected drug, which was involved in multiple system. There was a high signal intensity of dysgeusia (ROR = 72.98), diarrhea (ROR = 3.03) and headache (ROR = 1.25), which was compatible with the adverse reactions recorded in the manual for Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir. In addition, it was suggested that Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir might cause pale-colored stools (ROR = 45.53), chromaturia (ROR = 3.07), yellow skin (ROR = 3.62), tongue coating (ROR = 35.55) and other new adverse reactions (not included in the instructions manual for Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir). The ADEs of Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir that are not in the instructions and are highly relevant in the real world are supplemented, prompting clinical attention to the ADEs of the drug, and providing a theoretical basis for the safe and effective application of the drug.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: L.

Considering the growth in antidepressant prescription rates, SSRI-induced adverse events (AEs) need to be comprehensively clarified. Objective: This study was to investigate safety profiles and potential AEs associated with SSRIs using the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Methods: A retrospective pharmacovigilance analysis was conducted using the FAERS database, with Open Vigil 2.1 used for data extraction. The study included cases from the marketing date of each SSRI (ie, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline) to April 30, 2023. We employed the reporting odds ratio and Bayesian confidence propagation neural network as analytical tools to assess the association between SSRIs and AEs. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities was used to standardize the definition of AEs. AE classification was achieved using system organ classes (SOCs). Results: Overall, 427 655 AE reports were identified for the 6 SSRIs, primarily associated with 25 SOCs, including psychiatric, nervous system, congenital, familial, genetic, cardiac, and reproductive disorders. Notably, sertraline (n = 967) and fluvoxamine (n = 169) exhibited the highest and lowest signal frequencies, respectively. All SSRIs had relatively strong signals related to congenital, psychiatric, and nervous disorders. Conclusions and relevance: Most of our findings are consistent with those reported previously, but some AEs were not previously identified. However, AEs attributed to SSRIs remain ambiguous, warranting further validation. Applying data-mining methods to the FAERS database can provide additional insights that can assist in appropriately utilizing SSRIs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Silvio""=>""Included"", ""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.1177/10600280241231116,adolescent;adult;adverse drug reaction;aged;agenesis;agitation;androgen insensitivity syndrome;anterior chamber cleavage syndrome;anterior eye chamber disease;anxiety disorder;aorta anomaly;aortic atresia;aortic coarctation;aortic regurgitation;aortic valve atresia;article;artificial neural network;ataxia;atresia;bayesian confidence propagation neural network;benign neoplasm;bicuspid aortic valve;bladder malformation;bone anteversion;brain malformation;cardiovascular malformation;child;citalopram;coloboma;congenital absence of vertebra;congenital aortic valve stenosis;congenital central hypoventilation syndrome;congenital heart disease;congenital long QT syndrome;congenital malformation;congenital ureterovesical junction anomaly;congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries;craniofacial synostosis;cyst;data extraction;data mining;de Lange syndrome;diabetic complication;diabetic fetopathy;diaphragm eventration;drug intoxication;drug marketing;drug safety;ductus venosus agenesis;ear disease;endocrine disease;escitalopram;eye disease;eye malformation;Fallot tetralogy;familial disease;female;fetus disease;fluoxetine;fluvoxamine maleate;Food and Drug Administration;foot malformation;gastrointestinal discomfort;genetic disorder;genital system disease;great vessels transposition;heart atrium septum defect;heart disease;heart right ventricle double outlet;heart ventricle septum defect;hematologic disease;hepatobiliary disease;hepatomegaly;hereditary lymphedema;human;hypercoagulability;hypoplastic left heart syndrome;immunopathology;infant;infection;infestation;injury;inner ear disease;irritability;kidney disease;kinematic imbalances due to suboccipital strain;lipomeningocele;liver fibrosis;lymphatic system disease;major clinical study;male;marcus gunn syndrome;mediastinum disease;Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities;mental disease;middle aged;mitral valve atresia;mitral valve stenosis;multiple malformation syndrome;myoclonus dystonia;neurologic disease;neuropathy;newborn;nutritional and metabolic disorder;oculomotor apraxia;odds ratio;oscillopsia;paroxetine,,

EudraVigilance (EV) serves as the primary system for managing and analysing information concerning suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) within the European Economic Area. Despite its various functionalities, the current format for electronic submissions of safety reports lacks a specific data element indicating medicine exposure during pregnancy. Objective: This paper aims to address the limitations of existing approaches by developing a rule-based algorithm in EV that more reliably identifies cases that are truly representative of an ADR during pregnancy. Methods: The study utilised the standardised MedDRA query (SMQ) 'Pregnancy and neonatal topics' (PNT) as a benchmark for comparison. Recognising that the SMQ PNT also retrieves healthy pregnancy outcomes, contraceptive failure, failed abortifacients as well as ADRs not associated with pregnancy, a novel algorithm was tailored to improve the accuracy of identifying suspected ADRs occurring during pregnancy. Results: Upon testing, the algorithm demonstrated superior performance, correctly predicting 90% of cases reporting an ADR during pregnancy, compared to 54% achieved by the SMQ PNT. The implementation of the algorithm in EV led to the retrieval of 202,426 cases. Conclusion: The development and successful testing of the novel algorithm represents a step forward in pregnancy-specific signal detection in EV. Because signals associated with pregnancy may be diluted in a large database such as EV, this study lays the groundwork for future research to evaluate the effectiveness of disproportionality methods on a more refined subset of pregnancy-related ADR reports.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: G.

Despite their therapeutic benefits, mAb therapy has been associated with neurological toxicity. Objectives: This study aimed to assess the occurrence of neuronal toxicity associated with mAbs, utilizing data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) safety database. The study also sought to delineate the medical characteristics of the reported cases. Methods: A comprehensive analysis of neurological adverse events reported in the FAERS database was conducted, employing computational methodologies such as proportional relative risk (PRR), information component (IC025), and chi-square (χ2). Individual case safety reports (ICSRs) pertaining to neurological disorders linked to mAbs from the date of first global marketing authorization until June 30, 2023, were meticulously examined. Results: The FAERS safety database contains 79,022 ICSRs linking mAbs to nervous system disorders. Rituximab, bevacizumab, denosumab, nivolumab, and trastuzumab were frequently cited. Reported adverse events include headache, peripheral neuropathy, dizziness, and cerebrovascular accident. Most ICSRs (85.81%) were serious, mainly affecting females (57.04%) with a 14.09% fatality rate. Panitumumab, atezolizumab, bevacizumab, and trastuzumab showed strong drug-event associations. Signal disproportionate reporting (SDR) analysis flagged myasthenia gravis, peripheral neuropathy, and neurotoxicity across multiple mAbs, suggesting potential signals. Conclusions: Interdisciplinary collaboration between oncologists and neurologists is crucial for safe mAb use. Our study enhances understanding of mAb neurological safety. Disproportionality signal analysis provides valuable evidence for risk mitigation.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: M.K.

TDM is applied to many drug classes, including immunosuppressants, antineoplastic agents, and antibiotics. Considerable effort has been made to establish routine TDM practices for each drug. However, because TDM has been developed within the context of specific drugs, there is insufficient understanding of historical trends within the field of TDM research as a whole. In this study, we employed text-mining approaches to explore trends in the TDM research field. We first performed a PubMed search to determine which drugs and drug classes have been extensively studied in the context of TDM. This investigation revealed that the most commonly studied drugs are tacrolimus, followed by cyclosporine and vancomycin. With regard to drug classes, most studies focused on immunosuppressants, antibiotics, and antineoplastic agents. We also subjected PubMed records of TDM-related studies to a series of text-mining pipelines. Our analyses revealed how TDM research has evolved over the years, thereby serving as a cornerstone for forecasting future research trends.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: T.

SGAs also demonstrate antagonistic affinity for D2 receptors, indicating their potential to induce EPSs. This study utilized the Korea Adverse Event Reporting System (KAERS) database to explore adverse drug event (ADE) signals related to both FGAs and SGAs. Materials and Methods: Relevant ADE reports from January 2013 to December 2022 were extracted from the KAERS database and analyzed using disproportionality analysis, employing the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), reporting odds ratio (ROR), and information component (IC) with its 95% lower confidence interval (LCI) indices. Results: Of the initial dataset of 2,890,702 ADE reports, those with insufficient data and duplicates were removed, resulting in a final dataset of 5249 reports for analysis. Aripiprazole, an SGA, showed signals for movement disorders, including EPSs (PRR 4.7, ROR 4.8, IC 2.2), tremors (PRR 5.3, ROR 5.4, IC 2.4), and akathisia (PRR 18.6, ROR 19.3, IC 3.5). Notably, for quetiapine, cardiovascular signals were detected, including increased blood pressure (PRR 2.1, ROR 2.3, IC 0.5), and tachyarrhythmia (PRR 13.9, ROR 14.1, IC 1.8), along with peripheral edema (PRR 2.5, ROR 2.5, IC 0.2). Metabolic abnormalities, such as weight gain and increased appetite, were identified for four SGAs: aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone. Safety signals related to movement disorders were not detectable for FGAs, likely due to the limited number of ADE reports available for analysis. Conclusions: Our study findings support that the distribution of ADEs between FGAs and SGAs is not strictly binary. Aripiprazole, despite being an SGA, showed signals for extrapyramidal movement disorders. Four SGAs (aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone) were linked to metabolic side effects, while quetiapine was associated with cardiovascular safety signals.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: H.

However, investigations into its adverse drug reactions remain scant. This study seeks to utilize data mining techniques with the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database to assess adverse drug events (ADEs) linked to bempedoic acid. Methods: Based on the drug's market release timeline, we extracted data from the FAERS database covering the fourth quarter of 2020 through the fourth quarter of 2023 for disproportionality analysis. Results: This study gathered a total of 5,797,543 adverse event case reports, of which 735 were linked to bempedoic acid. These reports covered 19 System Organ Classes (SOCs) and 22 Preferred Terms (PTs). Predominantly, the musculoskeletal and nervous systems were implicated in these adverse events. By conducting PT-level screening, various signals for ADEs were detected, including myalgia (ROR 30.33, PRR 28.51, IC 4.83, EBGM 28.47), arthralgia (n = 34, ROR 6.34, PRR 6.09, IC 2.61, EBGM 6.09), tendon disorders (ROR 99.57, PRR 98.75, IC 6.62, EBGM 98.28), and dizziness (ROR 3.18, PRR 3.13, IC 1.65, EBGM 3.13). Particularly noteworthy was the hypertensive crisis (ROR 28.63, PRR 28.51, IC 4.83, EBGM 28.47), which exhibited a robust signal strength, an observation previously unreported in clinical studies and drug labeling. Conclusion: While our results are largely consistent with the drug's specifications, several new adverse reaction signals, such as hypertensive crisis, have not been previously documented. Therefore, further investigations are necessary to assess these unlabeled adverse reactions, offering crucial support for the clinical utilization of bempedoic acid.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Silvio""=>""Excluded"", ""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.1016/j.ijcard.2024.132305,abdominal pain;adult;adverse drug reaction;adverse event;aged;apparent life threatening event;arthralgia;article;bempedoic acid;cardiovascular disease;data mining;disability;dizziness;drug labeling;drug safety;drug surveillance program;female;Food and Drug Administration;gastrointestinal disease;heart arrhythmia;hospitalization;human;hyperlipidemia;hypertensive crisis;ICD-9;major clinical study;male;Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities;mild renal impairment;muscle weakness;myalgia;neurologic disease;outcome assessment;paresthesia;pharmacogenomics;pharmacovigilance;phenotype;phylogeny;postmarketing surveillance;quality control;retrospective study;side effect;tendon disease;treatment outcome;upper abdominal pain,,

They are often documented as free text in electronic health records (EHRs), making them challenging to use in clinical decision support systems (CDSS). The study aimed to develop a text mining algorithm to identify ADRs in free text of Dutch EHRs. Materials and Methods: In Phase I, our previously developed CDSS algorithm was recoded and improved upon with the same relatively large dataset of 35 000 notes (Step A), using R to identify possible ADRs with Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms and the related Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT) (Step B). In Phase II, 6 existing text-mining R-scripts were used to detect and present unique ADRs, and positive predictive value (PPV) and sensitivity were observed. Results: In Phase IA, the recoded algorithm performed better than the previously developed CDSS algorithm, resulting in a PPV of 13% and a sensitivity of 93%. For The sensitivity for serious ADRs was 95%. The algorithm identified 58 additional possible ADRs. In Phase IB, the algorithm achieved a PPV of 10%, a sensitivity of 86%, and an F-measure of 0.18. In Phase II, four R-scripts enhanced the sensitivity and PPV of the algorithm, resulting in a PPV of 70%, a sensitivity of 73%, an F-measure of 0.71, and a 63% sensitivity for serious ADRs. Discussion and Conclusion: The recoded Dutch algorithm effectively identifies ADRs from free-text Dutch EHRs using R-scripts and MedDRA/SNOMED-CT. The study details its limitations, highlighting the algorithm's potential and significant improvements.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: K.-I.

The post-marketing data concerning KRAS (G12C) inhibitors remain limited, and the outcomes of relevant studies are yet to yield conclusive evidence supporting the long-term safety of KRAS (G12C) inhibitors. Materials and methods: This investigation comprehensively assessed adverse events (AEs) attributed to KRAS (G12C) inhibitors by employing advanced data mining techniques, utilizing the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). The dataset encompasses the period from the first quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2024. A disproportionality analysis was conducted to quantify the correlation between KRAS (G12C) inhibitors and AEs. The metrics employed for the evaluation of disproportionality comprise the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the information component (IC), and the empirical Bayesian geometric mean (EBGM). Results: A total of 2,253 and 486 reports were identified as related to sotorasib and adagrasib, with the identification of 51 and 26 preferred terms, respectively. The most frequent AEs of sotorasib comprised diarrhoea (ROR 5.27), hepatotoxicity (ROR 38.09), alanine aminotransferase increased (ROR 17.41), aspartate aminotransferase increased (ROR 20.88), and hepatic function abnormal (ROR 19.88). The most common AEs of adagrasib included diarrhoea (ROR 4.21), nausea (ROR 3.84), vomiting (ROR 5.36), decreased appetite (ROR 4.79), and dehydration (ROR 7.00). A relatively reduced risk of hepatotoxicity but a increased risk of serious AEs in adagrasib compared to sotorasib (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Our findings would provide valued evidence for healthcare professionals to recognize AEs associated with KRAS (G12C) inhibitors and differences between sotorasib and adagrasib, and guide their clinical practice.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Silvio""=>""Excluded"", ""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.1016/j.lungcan.2024.107966,acne;acute respiratory distress syndrome;acute respiratory failure;adagrasib;adult;aged;alanine aminotransferase;article;aspartate aminotransferase;autoimmune hepatitis;Bayes theorem;brain disease;cholangitis;cholestasis;colitis;color vision defect;correlation analysis;data mining;decreased appetite;dehydration;dermatitis;diarrhea;disease severity;disorientation;drug-induced liver injury;enterocolitis;erythema;female;Food and Drug Administration;gastrointestinal toxicity;gene mutation;hemolytic anemia;human;hypertransaminasemia;hypocalcemia;hypokalemia;jaundice;K ras protein;kidney failure;liver failure;liver function;liver injury;liver pain;liver toxicity;lung embolism;lung toxicity;major clinical study;male;meningitis;mental disease;middle aged;musculoskeletal pain;nausea;non small cell lung cancer;odds ratio;oncogene K ras;pancreatitis;pericardial effusion;pharmacovigilance;pleura effusion;pneumonia;pulmonary hypertension;QT prolongation;risk assessment;seizure;sotorasib;standardization;toxic epidermal necrolysis;treatment outcome;vomiting;xerostomia,,

It is particularly beneficial when dealing with hierarchical data structures. One may use a retrospective case-control study design from spontaneous reporting systems (SRS) to investigate whether a specific adverse event of interest is associated with certain drugs. However, the existing Bernoulli model of the tree-based scan statistic may not be suitable as it fails to adequately account for dependencies within matched pairs. In this article, we propose signal detection statistics for matched case-control data based on McNemar's test, Wald test for conditional logistic regression, and the likelihood ratio test for a multinomial distribution. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform the existing approach in terms of the type I error rate, power, sensitivity, and false detection rate. To illustrate our proposed approach, we applied the three methods and the existing method to detect drug signals for dizziness-related adverse events related to antihypertensive drugs using the database of the Korea Adverse Event Reporting System.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: I.

The aims of this study were to validate the one-minute sit-to-stand test (STST) in congenital heart disease (CHD) children and to evaluate the possibility of predicting the peakVO2 using the STST in this paediatric population. Methods: Children (8- to 18-year-old) followed for a CHD and performing CPET were recruited prospectively. Concomitantly, they performed STST. The heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation (SpO2), muscular fatigue and dyspnoea were recorded before (t0), immediately after (t1) and 1 min after the end of the STST (t2). Results: We observed a poor but significant correlation between the STST and the peakVO2 (r = 0.306; p = 0.013). A significant difference between girls and boys were observed for peakVO2 (p < 0.001), HR t0 (p = 0.030), HR t1 (p = 0.002) and HR t2 (p < 0.001). The proposed model of prediction, including the number of STST, weight, height and age explains 37% of the predicted peakVO2 variance. Conclusion: The STST can provide relevant data on physical capacity in children with CHD. When CPET cannot be performed, we therefore propose an alternative equation using the STST as a surrogate of peakVO2 in CHD children.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Tópico desalinhado",10.1016/j.arbres.2024.05.008,adolescent;aerobic capacity;analyzer;anthropometry;article;athlete;beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent;body composition;body mass;calibrated gas analyser;calibration;carbon dioxide;cardiac stress monitoring system;cardiopulmonary exercise test;Cardiosoft;child;congenital heart disease;controlled study;cycling;data mining;dyspnea;electrocardiography monitoring;exercise;exercise test;fatigue;female;fitness;gas chromatography;heart rate;human;human experiment;lung gas exchange;major clinical study;male;metabolic measurement system;muscle fatigue;normal human;oximeter;Oxycon Pro;oxygen saturation;peak oxygen uptake;physical activity;physical capacity;prediction;prospective study;school child;sit-to-stand test;special situation for pharmacovigilance;tidal volume;training;visual analog scale,,

Methods: Data was collected in FAERS from the second quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2023 for data cleaning. Neurological adverse event (AE) signals of valbenazine were mined by calculating reporting odds ratios (ROR), information component (IC) and empirical Bayesian geometric mean (EBGM). The serious and non-serious cases and signals were prioritized using a rating scale. Results: The number of neurological AE reports where the primary suspect (PS) drug was 8981 for valbenazine. Significant AE signals were identified by the preferred term (PT) analysis for valbenazine, including somnolence (ROR 19.69), tremor (ROR 15.17), and tardive dyskinesia (ROR 236.91), among which 18 AEs were identified as new signals. Patient age (p < 0.009) and sex (p = 0.197) might be associated with an increased risk of neurological AE severity. Notably, the association between valbenazine and neurological disorders remained when stratified by sex, age, and reporter type. AE timing analysis was performed for the drug and four moderate clinical priority signals [i.e., somnolence, balance disorder, parkinsonism, and akathisia (priorities 7)], showing the same early failure type profiles. Conclusions: The increase in neurological safety signals is identified in the post-marketing research of valbenazine. Clinicians need to pay attention to not only common AEs but also be alert to new neurological AE signals when using valbenazine.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2024.06.005,adult;adverse drug reaction;age;aged;akathisia;amnesia;aphasia;article;attention disturbance;balance disorder;Bayes theorem;bradykinesia;calculation;cerebrovascular accident;cognitive defect;consciousness disorder;controlled study;coordination disorder;data mining;dementia;disease severity;dizziness;dysarthria;dystonia;empirical research;faintness;female;Food and Drug Administration;headache;human;hyperactivity;hypersalivation;hypesthesia;hypokinesia;lethargy;major clinical study;male;memory disorder;middle aged;migraine;neurologic disease;odds ratio;paresthesia;Parkinson disease;parkinsonism;pharmacovigilance;postmarketing surveillance;quantitative analysis;rating scale;restless legs syndrome;risk assessment;risk factor;seizure;sex;somnolence;speech disorder;tardive dyskinesia;transient ischemic attack;tremor;valbenazine;young adult,,

This study investigated the impact of TRI on in-hospital outcomes after PCI for coronary artery bypass graft vessels (GV-PCI). We analyzed patients who underwent GV-PCI in 2019–2022 from the Japanese nationwide registry. Patients were categorized into the TRI and trans-femoral PCI (TFI) groups. We assessed the association between TRI and in-hospital outcomes. The primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital death and major bleeding. In this study, 2,295 patients were analyzed. The primary outcomes occurred in 29 patients (1.3%), including 17 deaths (0.7%). Major bleeding occurred in 12 patients (0.5%), and access site bleeding in 7 patients (0.3%). The TRI group (n = 1,521) showed lower crude rates of the primary outcome (0.9% vs 1.9%, p = 0.039), major bleeding (0.3% vs 1.0%, p = 0.027), and access site bleeding (0.1% vs 0.6%, p = 0.047) compared with the TFI group (n = 774). Univariable logistic regression demonstrated a significant association of TRI with reduced primary outcome (odd ratio [OR] 0.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.22 to 0.98), major bleeding (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.80), and access site bleeding (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.94). In the multivariable analysis, TRI was still significantly associated with a decrease in major bleeding events (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.93).

Although conventional machine learning techniques have shown some success in this field, the scarcity of annotated toxicity data poses a significant challenge in enhancing models' performance. In this study, we explore the potential of leveraging large unlabeled small molecule data sets using semisupervised learning to improve drug cardiotoxicity predictive performance across three cardiac ion channel targets: the voltage-gated potassium channel (hERG), the voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav1.5), and the voltage-gated calcium channel (Cav1.2). We extensively mined the ChEMBL database, comprising approximately 2 million small molecules, and then employed semisupervised learning to construct robust classification models for this purpose. We achieved a performance boost on highly diverse (i.e., structurally dissimilar) test data sets across all three targets. Using our built models, we screened the whole ChEMBL database and a large set of FDA-approved drugs, identifying several compounds with potential cardiac ion channel activity. To ensure broad accessibility and usability for both technical and nontechnical users, we developed a cross-platform graphical user interface that allows users to make predictions and gain insights into the cardiotoxicity of drugs and other small molecules.

However, there is a lack of large-scale data relating to adverse events (AEs) related to its use. We aimed to explore the avapritinib-related AEs in real-world practice based on the post-marketing data. Methods: We extracted all avapritinib-related reports submitted to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) by June 2022. Based on disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis, we then calculated the reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), information component (IC) and empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM) to evaluate whether there is a significant association between avapritinib and AEs. Gender, age and time to onset were comparable between haemorrhage/non-haemorrhage, serious/non-serious, death/non-death AEs, respectively. Results: In total, 3120 cases related to avapritinib were documented in the FAERS database, and 44% were reported within 30 days of commencing avapritinib. A total of 331 different AE signals were detected, and no significant differences between males and females was identified. Although the number of AEs associated with an abnormal skin texture and executive dysfunction was small, the signal intensity is high, suggesting that these events are strongly correlated with avapritinib. Subgroup analysis showed that elderly male patients were more likely to suffer from serious AEs compared to females (P <.01), but there was no significant difference between the haemorrhage group and the non-haemorrhage group. Analysis of fatalities due to avapritinib-related AEs indicated that sex, age and time-to-onset were all significantly related to death (P <.05). Conclusion: Our study provides a more precise description of the incidence and characteristics of AEs after using avapritinib, clinicians should be particularly careful when prescribing avapritinib to elderly male patients, especially within the 30 days.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.1111/bcp.15673,abdominal discomfort;abdominal distension;adolescent;adult;aged;ageusia;algorithm;amnesia;anemia;aphasia;article;asthenia;avapritinib;balance disorder;Bayes theorem;bone pain;child;cognitive defect;confusion;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;data analysis;data mining;decreased appetite;depression;diarrhea;disease exacerbation;drug fatality;drug hypersensitivity;dry skin;dysgeusia;dyspepsia;edema;eye swelling;face edema;fatigue;female;Food and Drug Administration;hemoglobin;human;infant;insomnia;joint swelling;major clinical study;male;memory disorder;muscle weakness;nausea;neoplasm;newborn;paresthesia;periorbital edema;peripheral swelling;pharmacovigilance;photosensitivity;pleura effusion;postmarketing surveillance;side effect;signal detection;swelling;taste disorder;thrombocytopenia;tryptase;upper abdominal pain;very elderly,,

Our study aimed to detect sevoflurane-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus using data mining algorithms (DMAs) and molecular docking. The FAERS database was analysed using OpenVigil 2.1 for disproportionality analysis. Methods: We analysed FAERS data from 2004 to 2022 to determine the incidence of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus associated with sevoflurane. Reporting odds ratios (RORs) and proportional reporting ratios (PRRs) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. We also used molecular docking with AutoDock Vina to examine sevoflurane's binding affinity to relevant receptors. Results: A total of 554 nephrogenic diabetes insipidus cases were reported in FAERS, of which 2.5% (14 cases) were associated with sevoflurane. Positive signals were observed for sevoflurane with ROR of 76.012 (95% CI: 44.67–129.35) and PRR of 75.72 (χ2: 934.688). Of the 14 cases, 50% required hospitalization, 14% resulted in death, and the remaining cases were categorized as other outcomes. Molecular docking analysis showed that sevoflurane exhibited high binding affinity towards AQP2 (4NEF) and AVPR2 (6U1N) with docking scores of −4.9 and −5.3, respectively. Conclusions: Sevoflurane use is significantly associated with the incidence of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Healthcare professionals should be cautious when using this medication and report any adverse events to regulatory agencies. Further research is needed to validate these findings and identify risk factors while performing statistical adjustments to prevent false-positives. Clinical monitoring is crucial to validate potential adverse effects of sevoflurane.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: N.L.

Given the inherent constraints of conventional clinical trials, the correlation between BV and cardiac adverse events (AEs) remains enigmatic. The objective of this investigation is to comprehensively assess cardiac AEs attributed to BV by employing advanced data mining techniques, utilizing the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). The indices for the assessment of disproportionality encompass the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio, the information component, and the empirical Bayesian geometric mean. Employing these sophisticated metrics, we gauged the extent of disproportionate occurrences. The dataset was sourced from the FAERS from the first quarter of 2012 to first quarter of 2023, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of the potential correlation between BV and cardiac AEs. This scrutiny encompassed a comparative analysis of both cardiac and non-cardiac AEs. A total of 495 cases of BV’s cardiac AEs were discerned, with the identification of 31 preferred terms (PTs). Among these, 8 PTs emerged as conspicuous signals of cardiac AEs, notably encompassing ventricular hypokinesia (ROR 7.59), tachyarrhythmia (ROR 7.06), sinus tachycardia (ROR 6.18), cardiopulmonary failure (ROR 4.44), pericardial effusion (ROR 4.32), acute coronary syndrome (ROR 4.02), cardiomyopathy (ROR 3.30), and tachycardia (ROR 2.76).

Specifically, protein–protein interaction models predict drug effects from proteins surrounding drug targets, but they tend to overpredict drug phenotypes and require well-defined pathway phenotypes. In this study, we used PathFX, a protein–protein interaction tool, to predict side effects for active ingredient-side effect pairs extracted from drug labels. We observed limited performance and defined new pathway phenotypes using pathway engineering strategies. We defined new pathway phenotypes using a network-based and gene expression-based approach. Overall, we discovered a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity values and demonstrated a way to limit overprediction for side effects with sufficient true positive examples. We compared our predictions to animal models and demonstrated similar performance metrics, suggesting that protein–protein interaction models do not need perfect evaluation metrics to be useful. Pathway engineering, through the inclusion of true positive examples and omics measurements, emerges as a promising approach to enhance the utility of protein interaction network models for drug effect prediction.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: J.L.

Methods: We extracted adverse event reports of hematological malignancies (HMs) patients with clearly definable SPMs from the FAERS and VigiBase databases (2017–2023). Disproportionality analysis using reporting odds ratio (ROR) and adjusted ROR was performed to assess associations between SPMs and CAR-T therapy. Time-to-onset analysis explored factors affecting SPM manifestation. Findings: SPMs post CAR T-cell therapy include HMs and solid tumors. T-cell lymphoma and myelodysplastic syndromes were consistently identified as positive signals across the overall and subgroup analyses. Hematological SPMs showed earlier onset with increasing annual incidence post CAR-T therapy, whereas solid tumors exhibit delayed manifestation. SPMs in CAR-T recipients had significantly earlier onset than non-recipients. Furthermore, age-specific characteristics reveal earlier SPM manifestations in pediatric, adolescent, and young adult populations compared to older populations post CAR-T therapy. Interpretation: The current SPM profile highlights the necessity of long-term safety monitoring for all CAR-T recipients given the observed yearly increase of SPMs. Customizing long-term SPM screening across different age groups may enhance early detection and intervention strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes in the follow-up of CAR-T recipients.

The main aim of the current study is to identify potential marketed drugs that can be repurposed against bacterial infections. A pharmacovigilance-based drug repurposing approach was used to identify potential drugs. OpenVigil 2.1 tool was used to query the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) < 1, ROR95CI upper bound <1, and no. of cases ≥30 were used for filtering and sorting of drugs. Sunburst plot was used to represent drugs in a hierarchical order using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification. Molecular docking and dynamics were performed using the Maestro and Desmond modules of Schrodinger 2023 software respectively. A total of 40 drugs with different classes were identified based on the pharmacovigilance approach which has antibacterial potential. The molecular docking results have shown energetically favored binding conformation of lisinopril against 3-deoxy-manno-octulosonate cytidylyltransferase, UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine hydrolase, and penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP3) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa; olmesartan, atorvastatin against lipoteichoic acids flippase LtaA and rosiglitazone and varenicline against d-alanine ligase of Staphylococcus aureus; valsartan against peptidoglycan deacetylase (SpPgdA) and atorvastatin against CDP-activated ribitol for teichoic acid precursors of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Further, molecular dynamic results have shown the stability of identified drugs in the active site of bacterial targets except lisinopril with PBP3.

However, in the real world, there is a lack of relevant reports on adverse reaction data mining for fulvestrant. To perform data mining on adverse events (AEs) associated with fulvestrant and explore the risk factors contributing to severe AEs, providing a reference for the rational use of fulvestrant in clinical practice. Retrieved adverse event report information associated with fulvestrant from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, covering the period from market introduction to September 30, 2023. Suspicious AEs were screened using the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and proportional reporting ratio methods based on disproportionality analysis. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted on severe AEs to explore the risk factors associated with fulvestrant-induced severe AEs. A total of 6947 reports related to AEs associated with fulvestrant were obtained, including 5924 reports of severe AEs and 1023 reports of non-severe AEs. Using the disproportionality analysis method, a total of 210 valid AEs were identified for fulvestrant, with 45 AEs (21.43%) not listed in the product labeling, involving 11 systems and organs. The AEs associated with fulvestrant were sorted by frequency of occurrence, with neutropenia (325 cases) having the highest number of reports. By signal strength, injection site pruritus showed the strongest signal (ROR = 658.43). The results of the logistic regression analysis showed that concurrent use of medications with extremely high protein binding (≥ 98%) is an independent risk factor for severe AEs associated with fulvestrant. Age served as a protective factor for fulvestrant-related AEs. The co-administration of fulvestrant with CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitors did not show statistically significant correlation with the occurrence of severe AEs. Co-administration of drugs with extremely high protein binding (≥ 98%) may increase the risk of severe adverse reactions of fulvestrant. Meanwhile, age (60-74 years) may reduce the risk of severe AEs of fulvestrant. However, further clinical research is still needed to explore and verify whether there is interaction between fulvestrant and drugs with high protein binding through more clinical studies.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: J.

Liver function test elevations were observed in a greater proportion of patients receiving ETI compared with placebo; however, the relatively small number of patients and short duration of study preclude detection of rare but clinically significant associations with drug-induced liver injury (DILI). To address this gap, we assessed the real-world risk of DILI associated with ETI through data mining of the FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS). Methods: Disproportionality analyses were conducted on FAERS data from the fourth quarter of 2019 through the third quarter of 2022. Comparative patient demographics, onset time and outcomes for ETI-DILI were also obtained. Results: 452 reports of DILI associated with ETI were found, representing 2.1 % of all adverse event reports for ETI. All disproportionality measures were significant for ETI-DILI at p < 0.05; the reporting odds ratio (ROR) (2.82) was comparable to that of drugs classified by FDA as “Most-DILI concern”. The most notable demographic finding was a male majority (5:4 male to female ratio) for ETI-DILI compared to a female majority (4:5 male to female ratio) for non ETI-DILI. Median ETI-DILI onset time was 50.5 days, and hospitalization was the second most common complication. Conclusion: Using FAERS data, ETI was found to be disproportionately associated with DILI. Future research is needed to investigate the hepatotoxic mechanisms and assess potential mitigation strategies for ETI-induced hepatotoxicity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.1016/j.jcf.2024.01.001,abdominal discomfort;abdominal pain;acute kidney failure;adult;alanine aminotransferase;alanine aminotransferase blood level;article;aspartate aminotransferase;aspartate aminotransferase blood level;controlled study;data mining;demographics;dry eye;elexacaftor plus ivacaftor plus tezacaftor;female;fever;Food and Drug Administration;gamma glutamyl transferase blood level;gamma glutamyltransferase;hepatic encephalopathy;hospital patient;hospitalization;human;liver failure;liver function test;liver injury;liver necrosis;major clinical study;male;middle aged;patient monitoring;pharmacovigilance;placebo;respiratory tract disease,,

Materials and Methods: We collected data on UTIs and fungal infections related to metformin, SGLT-2 inhibitors, and their combinations from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. We calculated the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to assess the risk associated with these adverse events when using these medications. We evaluated differences in categorical variables using the Chi-squared test. Results: SGLT-2 inhibitors present a higher risk of UTIs and fungal infections compared to metformin. Empagliflozin showed the lowest risk of UTIs (ROR 0.928, 95% CI 0.858–1.005), while dapagliflozin exhibited the lowest risk of fungal infections (ROR 0.874, 95% CI 0.815–0.938). Additionally, patients using SGLT-2 inhibitors alone reported more cases of UTIs and fungal infections than those treated with a combination of SGLT-2 inhibitors and metformin (ROR>1). Conclusion: SGLT-2 inhibitors are associated with an increased risk of UTIs and fungal infections compared to combination therapy with an SGLT-2 inhibitor and metformin. The reduced infection reports with combined SGLT-2 inhibitors and metformin therapy may be due to the potential antimicrobial activity of metformin.","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;39</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.14744/cpr.2024.60933,acute kidney failure;adult;Adverse drug events;aged;antidiabetic drugs;antimicrobial activity;article;canagliflozin;canagliflozin plus metformin;confidence interval;controlled study;COTRANSPORTER 2 INHIBITORS;dapagliflozin;dapagliflozin plus metformin;data mining;DIABETES-MELLITUS;diagnostic test accuracy study;diarrhea;disease risk assessment;disproportionality analysis;empagliflozin;empagliflozin plus metformin;ertugliflozin;ertugliflozin plus metformin;female;FOCUS;Food and Drug Administration;human;hypoglycemia;infection;lactic acidosis;male;metformin;middle aged;multivariate analysis;mycosis;nausea;odds ratio;pharmacovigilance;prescription;sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor;THERAPY;TYPE-2;urinary tract infection,,

However, its adverse events (AEs) have not been investigated in real-world settings. Aim: This study aimed to detect and evaluate AEs associated with teprotumumab in the real-world setting by conducting a pharmacovigilance analysis of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. Method: Reporting odds ratio (ROR) was used to detect risk signals from the data from January 2020 to March 2023 in the FAERS database. Results: A total of 3,707,269 cases were retrieved, of which 1542 were related to teprotumumab. The FAERS analysis identified 99 teprotumumab-related AE signals in 14 System Organ Classes (SOCs). The most frequent AEs were muscle spasms (n = 287), fatigue (n = 174), blood glucose increase (n = 121), alopecia (n = 120), nausea (n = 118), hyperacusis (n = 117), and headache (n = 117). The AEs with strongest signal strengths were autophony (ROR = 14,475.49), deafness permanent (ROR = 1853.35), gingival recession (ROR = 190.74), deafness neurosensory (ROR = 129.89), nail growth abnormal (ROR = 103.67), onychoclasis (ROR = 73.58), ear discomfort (ROR = 72.88), and deafness bilateral (ROR = 62.46). Eleven positive AE signals were found at the standardized MedDRA queries (SMQs) level, of which the top five SMQs were hyperglycemia/new-onset diabetes mellitus, hearing impairment, gastrointestinal nonspecific symptoms and therapeutic procedures, noninfectious diarrhea, and hypertension. Age significantly increased the risk of hearing impairment. Conclusion: This study identified potential new and unexpected AE signals of teprotumumab. Our findings emphasize the importance of pharmacovigilance analysis in the real world to identify and manage AEs effectively, ultimately improving patient safety during teprotumumab treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.1007/s11096-023-01676-9,abdominal discomfort;adult;age;aged;alopecia;amenorrhea;article;asthenia;autophony;bilateral hearing loss;body weight loss;bradycardia;connective tissue disease;consciousness disorder;data analysis;data mining;decreased appetite;diabetes mellitus;diarrhea;diverticulitis;dizziness;drug efficacy;drug safety;dry skin;dysgeusia;ear disease;elevated blood pressure;endocrine ophthalmopathy;epistaxis;factual database;fatigue;female;Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database;gastrointestinal discomfort;gingiva disease;headache;hearing disorder;hearing impairment;heart palpitation;hematochezia;human;hyperacusis;hyperglycemia;hypertension;infusion related reaction;inner ear disease;major clinical study;male;metabolic disorder;muscle spasm;musculoskeletal disease;nail disease;nausea;nutritional disorder;onychoclasis;outcome assessment;patient safety;perception deafness;pharmacovigilance;risk benefit analysis;signal processing;teprotumumab;tinnitus,,

Objective: This study aimed to assess the toxicity profiles of three anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies (dinutuximab, dinutuximab β, and naxitamab) in clinical applications by mining and evaluating the adverse drug reaction (ADR) signals from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System. Methods: Data in the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System from the time anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies became available in the market to the first quarter of 2023 were searched. The signals of anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody-associated ADRs were quantified using four types of algorithms, including the reporting odds ratio, the proportional reporting ratio, the combination of the proportional reporting ratio and χ2 statistic method used by the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, and the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network. The ADRs were categorized by System Organ Class based on the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, and were sorted according to the frequency and signal strength of ADRs. Results: A total of 370 adverse drug event reports with anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies listed as the ‘primary suspected drugs’ were identified, with 116 ADR signals detected, of which 22 were not in the drug labels. Among the adverse drug event reports, 276 reports concerned dinutuximab/dinutuximab β as primary suspected drugs with 90 ADR signals, involving 19 System Organ Classes, of which 21 signals were not in the label; 94 adverse drug event reports concerned naxitamab as the primary suspected drug with 26 ADR signals, involving 11 System Organ Classes, of which one was not in the label. For dinutuximab/dinutuximab β-related ADRs, the top five most frequent were “fever”, “abdominal pain”, “elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST)”, “elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT)” and “hypotension”; the top five most intensive signals were “hypoalbuminemia”, “elevated AST”, “capillary leakage syndrome”, “hypoxia” and “elevated ALT”. For naxitamab-related ADRs, the top five most frequent were “hypotension”, “pain”, “urticarial”, “hypertension” and “rash”; the top five most intensive signals were “hypotension”, “urticaria”, “hypoxemia”, “bronchospasm” and “hypertension”. Involved System Organ Classes included “investigations” and “respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders” containing the most types of ADR signals in dinutuximab/dintuximab β-related ADRs and naxitamab-related ADRs, respectively.

The aim of this study was to explore and systematically analyze the potential link between five PPIs and the rhabdomyolysis events using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. Methods: Suspected rhabdomyolysis events associated with PPIs were identified by data mining with the reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the information component (IC), and Empirical Bayes Geometric Mean (EBGM). Demographic information, drug administration, and outcomes of PPI-induced rhabdomyolysis events were also analyzed. Results: There were 3311 reports associated with PPI-induced rhabdomyolysis that were identified. After removing duplicates, 1899 cases were determined to contain complete patient demographic data. The average age was 65 ± 18 year and 57% were male. Omeprazole and pantoprazole had the same largest percentage of reports. Lansoprazole had the highest ROR index of 12.67, followed by esomeprazole (11.18), omeprazole (10.27), rabeprazole (10.06), and pantoprazole (9.24). PRR, IC, and EBGM showed similar patterns. This suggested that lansoprazole exhibited the strongest correlation with rhabdomyolysis. In rhabdomyolysis events, PPIs were mainly “concomitant” (>60%), and only a few cases were “primary suspects” (<15%). Rabeprazole showed the lowest death rate while lansoprazole showed the highest. Conclusions: The study suggested that significant rhabdomyolysis signals were associated with PPIs.

However, the utilization of textual data from social media in the healthcare management industry is still somewhat limited when it is compared to other industries. Investigating how current machine learning and natural language processing technologies can be used in the healthcare industry to gauge public sentiment is an important study. Earlier works on healthcare sentiment analysis have utilized traditional word embedding models trained on the general and medical corpus. However, integration of medical knowledge to pre-trained word embedding models has not been considered yet. Word embedding models trained on the general corpus led to the problem of lacking medical knowledge and the models trained on the small size of the medical corpus have limitations in capturing semantic and syntactic properties. This research proposes a new word embedding model named Word Embedding Integrated with Medical Knowledge Vector (WE-iMKVec). The proposed model integrates sentiment lexicons and medical knowledgebases into the pre-trained word embedding to enrich the properties of word embedding. A new medical-aware sentiment polarity score is proposed for the utilization in learning neural-network sentiment and these vectors incorporate with the original pre-trained word vectors. The resulting vectors are enriched with lexicon vectors and the medical knowledge vectors: Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) vector and Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) vector are used to build the proposed WE-iMKVec model. WE-iMKVec is validated on the five different social media healthcare review datasets and the empirical results showed its superiority over traditional word embedding models in medical sentiment analysis. The highest improvement can be found in the patients.info medical condition dataset where the proposed model outperforms three conventional word2vec models (Google-News, PubMed-PMC, and Drug Reviews) by 12.7 %, 31.4 %, and 25.4 % respectively in terms of F1 score.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Dados de bases não oficiais",10.1016/j.artmed.2023.102758,adverse drug reaction;article;book;classification;commercial phenomena;controlled study;decision making;deep learning;drug utilization review;female;health care industry;health care management;human;knowledge;learning;machine learning;marketing;natural language processing;nerve cell network;politics;public opinion;sentiment analysis;social media;therapy;Unified Medical Language System,,

Reporting odds ratio (ROR) data analysis strategy was used for mining of signal strength that represents gender differences in ADEs related to Osimertinib. Results: The number of Osimertinib ADE reports included in the analysis was 7968 in females and 7570 in males, respectively. According to ROR, men were more likely to develop pneumonia aspiration, lung infection, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary toxicity, dyspnea, ventricular extrasystoles, and pulmonary thrombosis, while women were more likely to develop cardiac failure congestive, stomatitis, diarrhea, muscle spasms, nail disorder, onycholysis, skin disorder, dry skin, and rash. Conclusion: Gender differences existed in ADE signals related to Osimertinib. The higher risk of ADEs in male patients was lung diseases that seem more serious than those nail toxicities or skin problems that occurred in female patients.

Methods: In order to evaluate the disproportionality of AEs associated with tenecteplase and alteplase in real-world data, four algorithms (ROR, PRR, BCPNN, EBGM) were utilized as measures to detect signals of AEs related to both drugs. Subsequently, Breslow-Day statistical analysis was applied to compare the RORs of the main system organ classes (SOCs) and key preferred terms (PTs) between tenecteplase and alteplase. Results: A statistical analysis was performed utilizing data gleaned from the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, encompassing 19,514,140 case reports from 2004Q1 to 2023Q1. There were 1,004 cases where tenecteplase was reported as the primary suspected (PS) and 2,363 tenecteplase-related adverse drug reactions (ADRs) at the PTs level were identified, the two data of alteplase were 10,945 and 25,266, respectively. The occurrence of drug-induced ADRs was analyzed across 27 organ systems, The analysis revealed several expected ADRs, such as Haemorrhage, Hypersensitivity which were consistent with the two drug-labels. It is of note that the signal strengths of ‘death,’ ‘ventricular fibrillation,’ ‘cardiogenic shock’ and ‘pneumonia aspiration’ at the PT level were markedly higher for tenecteplase than for alteplase, whereas the signal strength of ‘angioedema’ at the PT level was significantly higher for alteplase in comparison to tenecteplase. Additionally, unexpected significant ADRs associated with ocular adverse reactions and pneumonia aspiration at the PT level were identified, indicating potential AEs not currently mentioned in the drug instructions. Conclusion: This study identified and compared signals of ADRs associated with tenecteplase and alteplase, although tenecteplase is as effective as alteplase and has advantages such as ease of use and affordability, it cannot replace alteplase in the treatment of AIS until its safety profile is fully recognized. Additionally, previously unreported ocular ADRs and pneumonia were identified, providing valuable insights into the relationship between ADRs and the use of these thrombolytic drugs. These findings underscore the importance of continuous monitoring and effective detection of AEs to ultimately enhance the safety of AIS patients undergoing thrombolytic therapy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.1080/14740338.2023.2245745,actilyse;acute heart infarction;acute ischemic stroke;adult;adverse event;aged;algorithm;alteplase;angioneurotic edema;aphasia;article;aspiration pneumonia;bleeding;brain hematoma;brain hemorrhage;brain infarction;cardiogenic shock;cathflo activase;cerebral blindness;cerebrovascular accident;chi square test;clinical monitoring;congenital disorder;congenital malformation;consumer;controlled study;data extraction;data mining;data processing;death;disability;drug efficacy;drug identification;drug indication;drug information;drug safety;ECG abnormality;eye disease;eye movement disorder;familial disease;female;fibrinolytic therapy;Food and Drug Administration;genetic disorder;groups by age;health practitioner;heart arrest;heart arrhythmia;heart disease;heart infarction;heart ventricle fibrillation;heart ventricle tachycardia;hematologic disease;hematoma;hemianopia;hepatobiliary disease;high level group term;hospitalization;human;hypersensitivity;hypotension;immunopathology;infection;infestation;injury;intoxication;ischemic stroke;larynx edema;lip edema;lowest level term;lung edema;lung embolism;lung hemorrhage;lymphatic system disease;major clinical study;male;mediastinum disease;Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities;medical procedures;metalyse;neurologic disease;patient safety;pharmacist;pharmacovigilance;physician;postmarketing surveillance;postoperative complication;preferred term;pupil disease;quadrantanopia;respiratory tract disease;retina detachment;retina macula hole;retina tear;retrospective study;risk assessment;seizure;ST segment elevation;statistical analysis;subarachnoid hemorrhage;surgery;system organ class;tenecteplase;thorax disease;TNKase;tongue edema;treatment outcome;United States;urticaria;vascular disease,,

Understanding all potential adverse drug events (ADEs) associated with GABA will guide clinical decision-making for pain management. Methods: A 20% sample of Medicare enrollees with new chronic pain diagnoses in 2017–2018 was selected. GABA users were those with >=30 consecutive days prescription in a year without opioid prescription. Opioid users were similarly defined. The control group used neither of these drugs. Propensity score match across three groups based on demographics and comorbidity was performed. We used proportional reporting ratio (PRR), Gamma Poisson Shrinker, and tree-based scan statistic (TBSS) to detect ADEs within 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-up. Results: Immunity disorder was detected within 3 months of follow-up by PRR compared to opioid use (PRR:2.33), and by all three methods compared to controls. Complications of transplanted organs/tissues and schizophrenia spectrum/other psychotic disorders were consistently detected by PRR and TBSS within 3 months. Skin disorders were detected by TBSS; and stroke was detected by PRR within 3 months compared to opioid use (PRR:4.74). Some malignancies were detected by PRR within 12 months. Other signals detected in GABA users were neuropathy and nerve disorders. Conclusions: Our study identified expected and unexpected ADE signals in GABA users. Neurological signals likely related to indications for GABA use. Signals for immunity, mental/behavior, and skin disorders were found in the FDA adverse event reporting system database. Unexpected signals of stroke and cancer require further confirmatory analyses to verify.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Naõ utiliza bases oficiais | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Dados de bases não oficiais",10.1002/pds.5685,adverse drug reaction;article;cerebrovascular accident;chronic pain;clinical article;clinical decision making;comorbidity;controlled study;data mining;demographics;follow up;human;immunopathology;information processing;malignant neoplasm;medicare;nervous system;neuropathy;opiate;prescription;propensity score;psychosis;signal detection,,

This study explored the cardiac AEs of TKIs through the Food and Drug Administration’s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Methods: Disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis were utilized for data mining of the suspected cardiac AEs of TKIs, based on FAERS data from January 2004 to December 2021. Results: A total of 4708 cardiac AEs reports of sorafenib, regorafenib, lenvatinib, and cabozantinib were identified. Hypertension accounts for the most reported cardiac AE. Lenvatinib appears to induce cardiac failure with the highest signals strength [ROR = 7.7 (3.46,17.17)]. Acute myocardial infarction was detected in lenvatinib [ROR = 7.91 (5.64,11.09)] and sorafenib [ROR = 2.22 (1.74, 2.84)]. Acute coronary syndrome was detected in lenvatinib [ROR = 11.57 (6.84, 19.58)] and sorafenib [ROR = 2.81 (1.87,4.24)]. Atrial fibrillation was detected in sorafenib [ROR = 1.82 (1.55,2.14)] and regorafenib [ROR = 1.36 (1.03,1.81)]. Meanwhile, aortic dissections were detected in sorafenib [ROR = 5.08 (3.31,7.8)] and regorafenib [ROR = 3.39 (1.52,7.56)]. Most patients developed hypertension and cardiac failure within 30 days of initiating TKI treatments. Patients taking lenvatinib had an increased incidence of developing acute coronary syndrome after 180 days of treatment. Conclusion: Analysis of FAERS data provides a precise profile on the characteristics of cardiac AEs associated with different TKI regimens. Distinct monitoring and appropriate management are needed in the care of TKI recipients.","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;44</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.1080/14740338.2023.2251398,acute coronary syndrome;acute heart infarction;adult;aged;aortic dissection;AORTIC DISSECTION;aortic thrombosis;arterial hemorrhage;article;atrial fibrillation;Bayes theorem;bleeding;blood pressure fluctuation;cabometys;cabozantinib;cancer patient;CARCINOMA;Cardiac adverse events;cardiac discomfort;cardiomyopathy;cardiorenal syndrome;cardiotoxicity;clinical monitoring;controlled study;data mining;deep vein thrombosis;drug approval;drug industry;drug monitoring;drug safety;dry gangrene;embolism;FDA Adverse Events Reporting System;female;flushing;heart aneurysm;heart arrhythmia;heart failure;heart infarction;heart left ventricle failure;heart muscle ischemia;hepatocellular cancer;human;hyperemia;hypertension;hypertensive crisis;hypovolemic shock;incidence;internal hemorrhage;lenvatinib;LENVATINIB;lenvima;liver cell carcinoma;lymphedema;male;Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities;medical personnel;medication therapy management;myocarditis;nexavar;non-proportional analysis;orthostatic hypertension;pericardial effusion;peripheral artery thrombosis;pharmacovigilance;phlebitis;regorafenib;REGORAFENIB;retrospective study;right ventricular hypertrophy;shock;side effect;sinus tachycardia;sorafenib;SORAFENIB;stivarga;superficial thrombophlebitis;supraventricular tachycardia;systolic hypertension;Takotsubo cardiomyopathy;THERAPY;thrombophlebitis migrans;tyrosine kinases inhibitors;vasodilatory shock;ventricular hypokinesia;worker,,

Safety data for these medicines are based on controlled clinical trials and case reports, limiting the knowledge about less frequent, rare or unique population adverse events excluded from clinical trials. Objective: This study aims at analyzing the reports of Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) related to these two medicines, focusing on events in pregnant women and foetuses. Methods: Data from the open-access FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from 2020 to 2022 were used to create a dashboard on the Grafana platform to ease querying and analyzing report events. Potential safety signals were generated using the ROR disproportionality measure. Results: Remdesivir was notified as the primary suspect in 7,147 reports and tocilizumab in 19,602. Three hundred and three potential safety signals were identified for remdesivir, of which six were related to pregnant women and foetuses (including abortion and foetal deaths). Tocilizumab accumulated 578 potential safety signals, and three of them were associated with this population (including neonatal death). Discussion: None of the possible signals generated for this population were found in the product labels. According to the NIH and the WHO protocols, both medicines are recommended for pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19. Conclusion: Despite the known limitations of working with open data from spontaneous reporting systems (e.g., absence of certain clinical data, underreporting, a tendency to report severe events and recent medicines) and disproportionality analysis, the findings suggest concerning associations that need to be confirmed or rejected in subsequent clinical studies.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: D.

Moreover, potential toxicological mechanisms of CDK4/6is-related liver injury were explored via drug–gene network analysis. Methods: In this retrospective observational study, we collected reports of DILI associated with CDK4/6i use from the FAERS dated January 2014 to March 2023. We conducted disproportionality analyses using the reporting odds ratio (ROR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Pathway enrichment analysis and drug-gene network analyses were subsequently performed to determine the potential mechanisms underlying CDK4/6i-induced liver injury. Results: We found positive signals for DILI with ribociclib (ROR = 2.60) and abemaciclib (ROR = 2.37). DILIs associated with liver-related investigations, signs, and symptoms were confirmed in all three reports of CDK4/6is. Moreover, ascites was identified as an unlisted hepatic adverse effect of palbociclib. We isolated 189 interactive target genes linking CDK4/6 inhibitors to hepatic injury. Several key genes, such as STAT3, HSP90AA1, and EP300, were revealed via protein-protein analysis, emphasizing their central roles within the network. KEGG pathway enrichment of these genes highlighted multiple pathways. Conclusion: Our study revealed variations in hepatobiliary toxicity among the different CDK4/6 inhibitors, with ribociclib showing the highest risk of liver injury, followed by abemaciclib, while palbociclib appeared relatively safe. Our findings emphasize the need for cautious use of CDK4/6 inhibitors, and regular liver function monitoring is recommended for long-term CDK4/6 inhibitor use.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 6; Correspondence Address: Q.

Previous research described the potential risks of Kampo formula-linked pseudoaldosteronism. However, few studies assessed the risk factors using a real-world database and a data-mining approach. Using the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database, we extracted pseudoaldosteronism reports for 148 Kampo formulas covered by Japanese national health insurance. Adverse events were decided according to the preferred terminology of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities/Japanese version 25.1. We calculated reporting odds ratio (RORs) and identified Kampo formulas as suspected causes of pseudoaldosteronism. Moreover, we evaluated clinical factors associated with Kampo formula-induced pseudoaldosteronism via logistic regression. From April 2004 to November 2022, 6334 adverse events related to the Kampo formulas were reported. We selected 2471 reports containing complete clinical data, including 210 reports on pseudoaldosteronism. In the pseudoaldosteronism group, 69.0% of patients were female, and 85.2% were ≥70 years old. The formulas most commonly associated with pseudoaldosteronism were Shakuyakukanzoto, Yokukansan, and Ryokeijutsukanto (ROR [95% confidence interval {CI}] = 18.3 [13.0–25.9], 8.1 [5.4–12.0], and 5.5 [1.4–21.9], respectively). Logistic analysis identified female sex (odds ratio [OR] [95% CI] = 1.7 [1.2–2.6]; P = 0.006), older age (≥70, 5.0 [3.2–7.8]; P < 0.001), low body weight (<50 kg, 2.2 [1.5–3.2]; P < 0.001), diuretics usage (2.1 [1.3–4.8]; P = 0.004), hypertension (1.6 [1.1–2.4]; P = 0.014), and dementia (7.0 [4.2–11.6]; P < 0.001) as pseudoaldosteronism-related factors. Additionally, the daily Glycyrrhiza dose (OR = 2.1 [1.9–2.3]; P < 0.001) and duration of administration (>14 days, OR = 2.8 [1.7–4.5]; P < 0.001) were associated with adverse events. We did not observe an interaction between aging and hypertension. Careful follow-up is warranted during long-term Glycyrrhiza-containing Kampo formula use in patients with multiple clinical factors for pseudoaldosteronism.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: F.

Methods: We used proportional imbalance analysis to evaluate the correlation between ICS/INCs and infection events. The data was extracted from the FAERS database from April 2015 to September 2023. Further analysis was conducted on the clinical characteristics, site of infection, and pathogenic bacteria of ICS and INCs infection adverse events (AEs). We used bubble charts to display their top 5 infection adverse events. Results: We analyzed 21,837 reports of infection AEs related to ICS and INCs, with an average age of 62.12 years. Among them, 61.14% of infection reports were related to females. One-third of infections reported to occur in the lower respiratory tract with Fluticasone, Budesonide, Ciclesonidec, and Mometasone; over 40% of infections reported by Triamcinolone Acetonide were eye infections; the rate of oral infections caused by Beclomethasone were 7.39%. The reported rates of fungal and viral infections caused by beclomethasone were 21.15% and 19.2%, respectively. The mycobacterial infections caused by Budesonide and Ciclesonidec account for 3.29% and 2.03%, respectively. Bubble plots showed that the ICS group had more fungal infections, oral infections, pneumonia, tracheitis, etc. The INCs group had more eye symptoms, rhinitis, sinusitis, nasopharyngitis, etc. Conclusion: Women who use ICS and INCs are more prone to infection events. Compared to Budesonide, Fluticasone seemed to have a higher risk of pneumonia and oral candidiasis. Mometasone might lead to more upper respiratory tract infections. The risk of oral infection was higher with Beclomethasone. Beclomethasone causes more fungal and viral infections, while Ciclesonide and Budesonide are more susceptible to mycobacterial infections.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: Y.

The current study aimed to quantify the strength of association between the use of different AAPs and SD using real-world data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), as well as investigate the receptor mechanisms that are involved. Methods: Data from the FAERS database from the first quarter of 2004 to the third quarter of 2023 were queried through OpenVigil 2.1. Disproportionality analysis was estimated using the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information component (IC) methods, and linear regression was used to investigate the relationship between ROR and receptor occupancy which was estimated using in vitro receptor binding profiles. Results: Our analysis yielded 4839 reports that co-mentioned AAP and SD events, and the findings revealed statistical associations between 12 AAPs and SD. The highest signal value was identified for iloperidone reporting retrograde ejaculation with iloperidone (ROR = 832.09, ROR025 = 552.77; IC = 9.58, IC025 = 6.36), followed by compulsive sexual behavior with aripiprazole (ROR = 533.02, ROR025 = 435.90; IC = 7.30, IC025 = 5.97), and psychosexual disorder for aripiprazole (ROR = 145.80, ROR025 = 109.57; IC025 = 6.47, IC025 = 4.86). Different characteristics of the SD side effects in each AAPs were discovered after further data mining. Regression analysis revealed potential effects for receptor occupancy of D2, D3, and 5-HT1A receptors on ROR. However, no significant correlation persisted following sensitivity analyses. Conclusion: This is the first study to investigate the AAP-SD associations by using FAERS. In this study, we report for the first time a significant association between aripiprazole and SD based on real-world data. The study suggests that different AAPs have varying levels of association with SD, and the D2, D3, and 5-HT1A receptor occupancy may contribute to potential mechanisms. The findings of this study warrant further validation of more studies and clinical causality assessment.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: Q.

However, recent case reports have indicated new evidence regarding their association with acute kidney injury (AKI), with some patients experiencing acute tubular injury after PCSK9 inhibitors use. Objectives: To clarify the relationship between PCSK9 inhibitors and AKI, we conducted a pharmacovigilance study. Methods: Using the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database from the third quarter of 2015 to the fourth quarter of 2022, a disproportionality analysis was employed to identify adverse events suggestive of AKI after PCSK9 inhibitors use. The drugs of interest included evolocumab and alirocumab. Results: A total of 144,341 adverse event reports related to PCSK9 inhibitors were analyzed, among which 444 cases were suspected of AKI for evolocumab, and 172 cases for alirocumab. Evolocumab had a greater impact on AKI in males (ROR 1.4, 95% CI 1.54–1.69). The ROR and 95% CI for evolocumab and Alirocumab were 0.13 (0.12–0.14) and 0.26 (0.23–0.30) respectively. Further analysis of AKI associated with the concomitant use of PCSK9 inhibitors with cephalosporins, furosemide, torsemide, pantoprazole, omeprazole, and esomeprazole revealed ROR and 95% CI of 0.38 (0.23–0.62), 0.38 (0.31–0.48), 0.18 (0.08–0.38), 0.23 (0.17–0.29), 0.20 (0.16–0.26), and 0.14 (0.10–0.20) respectively. Conclusion: Through the FAERS database, we analyzed the clinical characteristics of AKI associated with PCSK9 inhibitors, exploring its risks. Our findings suggest that PCSK9 inhibitors might have a potential protective effect against AKI and exhibit similar effects when co-administered with other nephrotoxic drugs.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: H.

The aim of this study was to evaluate sacubitril/valsartan-induced adverse events (AEs) through data mining of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Methods: Reports in the FAERS from the third quarter of 2015 (FDA approval of sacubitril/valsartan) to the fourth quarter of 2023 were collected and analyzed. Disproportionality analyses, including the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), and empirical Bayesian geometric mean (EBGM) algorithms were adopted in data mining to quantify signals of sacubitril/valsartan-associated AEs. Results: A total of 12,001,275 reports of sacubitril/valsartan as the “primary suspected (PS)” and 99,651 AEs induced by sacubitril/valsartan were identified. More males than females reported AEs (59.95% vs. 33.31%), with the highest number of reports in the 60–70 years age group (8.11%), and most AEs occurred < 7 days (14.13%) and ≥ 60 days (10.69%) after dosing. Sacubitril/valsartan-induced AE occurrence targeted 24 system organ classes (SOCs) and 294 preferred terms (PTs). Of these, 4 SOCs were strongly positive for all four algorithms, including cardiac disorders, vascular disorders, ear and labyrinth disorders, and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. Among all PTs, consistent with the specification, hypotension (n = 10,078) had the highest number of reports, and dizziness, cough, peripheral swelling, blood potassium increased, and renal impairment were also reported in high numbers. Notably, this study also discovered a high frequency of side effects such as death, dyspnea, weight change, feeling abnormal, hearing loss, memory impairment, throat clearing, and diabetes mellitus. Conclusion: This study identified potential new AE signals and gained a more general understanding of the safety of sacubitril/valsartan, promoting its rational adoption in the cardiovascular system.","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;26</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.3389/fphar.2024.1392263,adult;adverse event;aged;algorithm;article;artificial neural network;bayesian confidence propagation neural network;cardiovascular system;coughing;data analysis;data analysis software;data extraction;data mining;demographics;diabetes mellitus;dizziness;dyspnea;empirical bayesian geometric mean;ENALAPRIL;FAERS database;female;Food and Drug Administration;hearing impairment;heart disease;HEART-FAILURE;hospitalization;human;hypotension;inner ear;inner ear disease;male;mediastinum disease;memory disorder;middle aged;NEPRILYSIN INHIBITION;peripheral swelling;pharmacovigilance;potassium blood level;R version 4.2.1;respiratory tract disease;sacubitril plus valsartan;sacubitril/valsartan;thorax disease;vascular disease;very elderly,,

We aimed to comprehensively and comparatively analyze the risk of ocular toxicity associated with various ADCs using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. Methods: Data were extracted from the FAERS database from Q3 2011 to Q3 2023. We analyzed the clinical characteristics of ADCs-related ocular adverse events (AEs). These data were further mined by proportional analysis and Bayesian approach to detect signals of ADCs-induced ocular AEs. Moreover, the time to onset of ocular toxicity was also evaluated. Results: A total of 1,246 cases of ocular AEs were attributed to ADCs. Ocular toxicity signals were observed in patients treated with belantamab mafodotin, brentuximab vedotin, enfortumab vedotin, mirvetuximab soravtansine, sacituzumab govitecan, trastuzumab deruxtecan, and trastuzumab emtansine. Of these, belantamab mafodotin, trastuzumab emtansine, and mirvetuximab soravtansine, whose payloads are microtubule polymerization inhibitors, were more susceptible to ocular toxicity. The ten most common ADCs-related ocular AEs signals are keratopathy [ROR = 1,273.52, 95% CI (1,129.26–1,436.21)], visual acuity reduced [ROR = 22.83, 95% CI (21.2–24.58)], dry eye [ROR = 9.69, 95% CI (8.81–10.66)], night blindness [ROR = 259.87, 95% CI (228.23–295.89)], vision blurred [ROR = 1.78, 95% CI (1.57–2.02)], photophobia [ROR = 10.45, 95% CI (9.07–12.05)], foreign body sensation in eyes [ROR = 23.35, 95% CI (19.88–27.42)], ocular toxicity [ROR = 144.62, 95% CI (117.3–178.32)], punctate keratitis [ROR = 126.21, 95% CI (101.66–156.69)], eye disorder [ROR = 2.71, 95% CI (2.21–3.32)]. In terms of onset time, sacituzumab govitecan displayed an earlier onset of 21 days, while trastuzumab deruxtecan exhibited the latest onset of 223 days. Conclusion: ADCs may increase the risk of ocular toxicity in cancer patients, leading to serious mortality. With the widespread application of newly launched ADCs, combining the FAERS data with other data sources is crucial for monitoring the ocular toxicity of ADCs. In addition, novel ocular toxicity signals not documented in product labeling were detected. Further research will be necessary to validate our findings in the future.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 6; Correspondence Address: H.

Nevertheless, its use in clinical practice has been affected by safety concerns. The work retrospectively investigated adverse events (AEs) of denosumab to better understand toxicities. Methods: The FAERS data base data from Q1 of 2010 to Q3 of 2023 was chosen. The definition of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) was dependent on preferred terms (PTs) and system organ class (SOCs). Following the removal of duplicate reports, a disproportionality analysis was conducted to identify safety signals through the calculation of reporting odds ratios (ROR). Results: During the reporting period, 130611 denosumab-related cases were identified; 670 pTs with a substantial disproportionality were retained. The connective and musculoskeletal tissue disorders, poisoning, injury, and procedural complications, as well as medical and surgical procedures, were among the important SOCs that satisfied the criteria. Reports at PT levels including off-label use, death, osteonecrosis of the jaw, arthralgia, and pain in extremities were determined. Severe consequences in terms of life-threatening injuries and death accounted for 841 and 19704 cases, respectively of the reported cases. Conclusion: These findings underscore the critical importance of pharmacovigilance and are consistent with established clinical observations. Notably, osteonecrosis of the jaw, arthralgia, pain in extremities, back pain, myalgia, and bone pain were identified as the most prevalent risk signals associated with denosumab.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: Y.

However, no comprehensive study has examined the relationship between drugs and libido. This study assessed drug-induced decreased libido by mining data from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Research Design and Methods: Adverse drug event (ADE) reports from the first quarter of 2004 to the fourth quarter of 2023 in FAERS were collected and screened for reports of decreased libido and were subjected to medication signal mining by using the disproportionality analysis. Results: Overall 10,773 ADE reports were obtained. Thirty-three of the top 50 drugs with the highest frequency of ADE reports did not mention the risk of reduced libido in their instructions. Fifty-eight drugs showed potential decreased libido risk based on the disproportionality analysis, with 40 of the drugs not mentioning the risk of reduced libido in their instructions. Of these 40 drugs, drugs used in genito urinary and sex hormones and nervous system were the drug class with the greatest number of ADE reports. Conclusion: A data mining exercise using FAERS for drugs that cause decreased libido has identified 40 drugs with new signals of adverse effects that should be closely monitored in medical practice.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.1080/14740338.2024.2411370,adult;amfebutamone;amfebutamone plus dextromethorphan;anastrozole;article;atomoxetine;bicalutamide;buprenorphine plus naloxone;chlortalidone;citalopram;clomipramine;clonazepam;data mining;degarelix;doxazosin;drospirenone;drospirenone plus ethinylestradiol;drospirenone plus ethinylestradiol plus mefolate calcium;drug induced disease;duloxetine;dutasteride;dutasteride plus tamsulosin;elagolix;escitalopram;estradiol plus norethisterone acetate plus relugolix;ethinylestradiol plus norethisterone acetate;ethinylestradiol plus norgestimate;ethinylestradiol plus norgestrel;etonogestrel;female;finasteride;flibanserin;fluoxetine;fluvoxamine;Food and Drug Administration;gemfibrozil;goserelin;human;isotretinoin;ketoconazole;leuprorelin;levonorgestrel;levothyroxine sodium;libido disorder;lurasidone;major clinical study;male;medroxyprogesterone;milnacipran;minoxidil;naltrexone;norethisterone;paliperidone;pamidronic acid;paroxetine;pegvisomant;pharmacovigilance;ramelteon;relugolix;risperidone;rotigotine;screening;sertraline;signal detection;silodosin;tadalafil;tamsulosin;testosterone;venlafaxine;vilazodone;vortioxetine,,

The relationship between TPO-RAs and thromboembolic events (TEEs) remains controversial. Research design and methods: We extracted TPO-RAs adverse reaction reports after their marketing until now, using the FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS). Positive signals were detected by reporting odds ratios (RORs). And the Weibull shape parameter test was utilized to analyze the time-to-onset profiles. Result: Thromboembolic events accounted for 8.97% among TPO-RAs reports. Increased reporting of TEEs was related to TPO-RAs treatment compared with the entire FAERS database [ROR = 2.65 (2.56, 2.73)]. In addition, venous thrombotic events [ROR = 4.13 (3.92, 4.35)] were reported more frequently than arterial events ROR = 1.81 (1.7, 1.93)]. Age over 60 years [odds ratio (OR) = 1.10 (1.01, 1.20), p = 0.029] and weight over 80 kg [OR = 1.36 (1.17, 1.58), p < 0.001] of patients might have higher risk of TEEs during TPO-RAs therapy. Conclusion: Evidence from the real world suggested that TPO-RAs were associated with higher incidence of TEEs, particularly venous thrombosis. The risk of TPO-RAs-associated TEEs mostly happened in the early stages of treatment and decreased over time.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.1080/14740338.2024.2416540,acute coronary syndrome;adult;aged;agonist;arterial thromboembolism;article;avatrombopag;brain infarction;cerebral sinus thrombosis;coronary artery thrombosis;coronary occlusion;corticosteroid;data mining;deep vein thrombosis;eltrombopag;fatality;female;Food and Drug Administration;heart infarction;human;immunoglobulin;incidence;kidney vein thrombosis;lung embolism;major clinical study;male;pharmacovigilance;portal vein thrombosis;risk assessment;risk factor;rituximab;romiplostim;thromboembolism;thrombopoietin receptor;venous thromboembolism;very elderly,,

Methods: Data were obtained from the FAERS database, covering the period from the first quarter of 2015 to the fourth quarter of 2023, focusing on reports where Genvoya® was the primary suspected drug. Data import and extraction were conducted using MySQL 8.0, with adverse events standardized according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA, Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) 27.0 terminology. Potential adverse event signals were identified through disproportionality analysis, including the reporting odds ratio (ROR, reporting odds ratio) method and the comprehensive standard by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) method. Statistical analyses and graphical representations were performed. Results: A total of 2, 376 adverse drug event reports related to Genvoya® were analyzed. Reports from male patients accounted for 74.33%, while those from female patients accounted for 22.39%. Common adverse events included weight gain, drug interactions, and increased viral load. Additionally, new potential adverse reactions, such as fat redistribution, HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, and meningoencephalitis, were identified. These reactions were not adequately described in the existing literature and drug labels. Conclusion: Multiple adverse reactions were observed with the use of Genvoya®. Clinicians should closely monitor these reactions and implement necessary preventive and intervention measures based on patient-specific conditions and treatment guidelines. Although this study has limitations, the analysis of FAERS database data has revealed various potential risks associated with Genvoya®, providing important safety references for HIV treatment.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: L.

Prompt identification of high-risk drugs provides a valuable basis for enhancing clinical drug safety. Methods: The adverse event reports related to coagulopathies from Q1 2004 to Q2 2024 were extracted from the ASCII data packages in FAERS. The reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), and Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) were used to identify adverse drug reaction signals associated with coagulopathies. Results: During the reporting period, 40,545 reports were retrieved, with a slightly higher proportion of females than males. Among the top 30 drugs associated with the occurrence of coagulopathies, 24 drugs exhibited positive signals in risk analysis. Based on the individual drug reporting odds ratio (95% confidence interval) as a measure of risk signal strength, the top five drugs are as follows: gemcitabine [ROR (95% CI):16.87 (15.83–17.98)], busulfan [ROR (95% CI):15.51 (13.69–17.58)], anti-thymocyte globulin [ROR (95% CI):15.49 (13.49–17.78)], tacrolimus [ROR (95% CI):12.7 (11.57–13.95)], etonogestrel and ethinylestradiol vaginal ring [ROR (95% CI):11.88 (10.95–12.89)]. After categorizing the drugs, the strongest risk signal is sex hormones and modulators of the genital system [ROR (95% CI):11.88 (10.95–12.89)], followed by analgesics [ROR (95%CI): 6.73 (6.38–7.1)], immunosuppressants [ROR (95% CI):3.91 (3.76–4.05)], antineoplastic agents [ROR (95% CI):3.33 (3.22–3.45)], corticosteroids for systemic use [ROR (95% CI): 2.94 (2.73–3.18)], antiepileptics [ROR (95% CI):1.93 (1.71–2.18)], drugs used in diabetes [ROR (95% CI):1.5 (1.34–1.67)], antibacterials for systemic use [ROR (95% CI):1.46 (1.28–1.68)]. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that multiple drugs are associated with an increased risk of coagulopathies. From the pharmacovigilance perspective, proactive analysis of these drugs aids in clinical monitoring and enhances risk identification of coagulopathies.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: H.

Methods: Reporting odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), and the multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS) were employed to quantify the signals of ABL-related AEs from 2017Quarter2 to 2022.Serious and non-serious cases were compared by Mann-Whitney U test or Chi-squared (χ 2) test. Results: We collected 8,470,497 reports from the FAERS database, including 11,487 reports defined ABL as the primary suspected (PS) drug. Additionally, 36.16% of the reports were submitted by healthcare professionals (n=4154), compared to 62.26% reported by consumers (n=7140). A total 99 signals simultaneously conforming to four algorithms were detected, among which, 35 signals were identified as unexpected signals. Such as growing pains (n=13), waist circumference increased (n=21), sensory disturbance (n=103), tinnitus (n=65), visual acuity reduced (n=54), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (n=61), and hair growth abnormal (n=13). Patient age (p < 0.001) might be associated with an increased risk of AEs severity. The most common timeframe for AE occurrence was 0–7 days. Conclusion: Our study provided a deeper and broader understanding of abaloparatide’s safety profiles, which would help healthcare professionals to mitigate the risk of AEs in clinical practice, a low number of unexpected AEs supporting ongoing additional pharmacovigilance.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.1007/s00198-023-06877-6,abaloparatide;abdominal pain;abnormal sensation;adult;age distribution;aged;alkaline phosphatase;alkaline phosphatase blood level;arthralgia;arthropathy;article;backache;body weight gain;bone pain;clinical practice;constipation;controlled study;contusion;data mining;disease severity;dizziness;drug safety;factual database;fatigue;female;Food and Drug Administration;fragility fracture;gastrointestinal discomfort;gingiva disease;gingiva erythema;hair disease;headache;heart arrhythmia;heart palpitation;heart rate;human;hypercalcemia;hyperphosphatemia;impaired fracture healing;injection site bleeding;injection site contusion;injection site discoloration;injection site discomfort;injection site erythema;injection site hypersensitivity;injection site irritation;injection site pain;injection site pruritus;injection site rash;injection site reaction;injection site urticaria;insomnia;jaw pain;limb pain;major clinical study;muscle spasm;muscle tightness;myalgia;nail disease;nausea;neck pain;nervousness;observational study;orthostatic hypertension;orthostatic hypotension;osteoporosis;Paget bone disease;pain;paranasal sinus disease;parathyroid disease;parathyroid hormone;pharmacovigilance;pollakisuria;postmarketing surveillance;postmenopause osteoporosis;retrospective study;rheumatoid arthritis;risk benefit analysis;risk reduction;senile osteoporosis;sensory dysfunction;side effect;skin tumor;sleep disorder;soft tissue tumor;spinal pain;stomach distension;tinnitus;tooth pain;trichorrhexis;vertigo;visual acuity;visual impairment;vomiting;waist circumference,,
rayyan-281079836,A holistic AI-based approach for pharmacovigilance optimization from patients behavior on social media,2023,,,Artificial Intelligence in Medicine,1873-2860,144,,,"Roche, V. and Robert, J.-P. and Salam, H.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2026719278&from=export,English,,,"In this paper, we propose a holistic AI-based pharmacovigilance optimization approach using patient's social media data. Instead of focusing on the detection and identification of Adverse Drug Events (ADE) in social media posts in single time points, we propose a holistic approach that looks at the evolution of different user behavior indicators in time. We examine various NLP-based indicators such as word frequency, semantic similarity, Adverse Drug Reactions mentions, and sentiment analysis. We introduce a classification approach to identify normal vs. abnormal time periods based on patient comments. This approach, along with user behavior indicators, can optimize the pharmacovigilance process by flagging the need for immediate attention and further investigation. We specifically focus on the Levothyrox® case in France, which sparked media attention due to changes in the medication formula and affected patient behavior on medical forums. For classification, we propose a deep learning architecture called Word Cloud Convolutional Neural Network (WC-CNN), trained on word clouds from patient comments. We evaluate different temporal resolutions and NLP pre-processing techniques, finding that monthly resolution and the proposed indicators can effectively detect new safety signals, with an accuracy of 75%. We have made the code open source, available via github.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Dados de bases não oficiais",10.1016/j.artmed.2023.102638,adult;adverse drug reaction;article;artificial intelligence;comparative study;controlled study;convolutional neural network;correlation analysis;data visualization;deep learning;deep neural network;detection algorithm;France;frequency analysis;human;levothyroxine sodium;machine learning;medical information;natural language processing;patient attitude;patient satisfaction;pattern recognition;pharmacovigilance;process optimization;public policy;recurrent neural network;sentiment analysis;signal detection;social media;social network,,

Due to the limitations of clinical trials, the association between quetiapine and rare cardiac adverse events (AEs) is still unclear. This study is to evaluate quetiapine-associated cardiac AEs through data mining of FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Methods: Reporting odds ratio (ROR) was used to quantify the signals of quetiapine-related cardiac AEs from the first quarter (Q1) of 2018–2022 Q1. Serious and nonserious cases were compared, and signals were prioritized using a rating scale. Results: A total of 1004 cases of quetiapine-associated cardiac AEs were identified, with 31 signals being detected, among which 13 AEs were identified as new and unexpected signals. Besides, nine and 22 cardiac AEs were identified as moderate and weak clinical priority. The median TTO for moderate and weak clinical priority signals were 0 and 4 days, respectively. All of the cardiac AEs had early failure type characteristics, suggesting that most of the patients developed cardiac AEs in a few days after quetiapine treatment, and that the risk of cardiac AEs occurrence would be gradually decreased over time. Conclusion: Our study provided valuable evidence for health-care professionals to mitigate the risk of quetiapine-associated cardiac AEs based on an extensive analysis of a real-world, large-sample FAERS database, and prioritize cardiac AE signals.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 19; Correspondence Address: L.

This study aimed to evaluate and compare the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular safety in patients receiving ranibizumab, bevacizumab, and aflibercept for ocular disease. A cross-sectional study was conducted from 2017 (Q1) to 2021 (Q4) in the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. The outcomes of interest were central nervous system vascular disorders, ischemic heart disease, hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, torsade de pointes/QT prolongation, embolic and thrombotic events, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, and cardiomyopathy. Data mining was performed by a disproportional method with a compression, using compressed reporting odds ratios (sRORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to measure signals. The results showed 1462 cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events associated with aflibercept, 834 with ranibizumab, and 150 with bevacizumab.

Large post-marketing databases are still lacking for safety analysis of the new generation of anti-seizure medications. Based on the FDA's adverse event reporting system (FAERS) database, this study aimed to investigate, assess, and offer evidence for the safety of PER to support clinical decision-making. Methods: Perampanel-related adverse reaction signals were mined using the reporting odds ratio (ROR), medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (MHRA), and Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN). The rate and occurrence of reported adverse responses were examined. Results: With the three methodologies used in combination, 83 signals mostly related to psychosis and different nervous system disorders were detected. Among them, suicide behavior, respiratory depression, hepatotoxicity, cognitive impairment, and other possible novel signals warranted consideration. Further examination of the age and gender differences in the detected signals revealed that elderly patients should be closely monitored for any change in consciousness and the occurrence of movement disorders; male patients should be observed for negative mental reactions like a personal attack and homicidal ideation; and female patients should be watched for the occurrence of negative reactions in memory, weight, vision, liver function, and other specific areas. Conclusions: This study found that PER had the risk of causing suicide behavior, respiratory depression, hepatotoxicity, and cognitive impairment among other adverse effects. When used clinically, PER should be closely monitored for the occurrence of adverse effects on mental health and behavior. However, these results should be interpreted with caution.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.1016/j.yebeh.2023.109283,acute psychosis;adverse outcome;age distribution;altered state of consciousness;amnesia;apnea;article;ataxia;attention disturbance;automutilation;balance disorder;behavior disorder;brain disease;clinical decision making;cognitive defect;coma;confusion;coordination disorder;data mining;delirium;delusion;depression;descriptive research;diplopia;dizziness;dose response;drug safety;dysarthria;dysphoria;epilepsy;erectile dysfunction;evidence based medicine;gastrointestinal disease;geriatric patient;hallucination;human;hyperammonemia;hypersalivation;hyponatremia;information processing;liver toxicity;mental disease;mental health;mood disorder;motor dysfunction;NCT00699582;NCT00699972;NCT00700310;neurologic disease;paranoia;perampanel;persecutory delusion;personality disorder;psychosis;reporting and data system;respiration depression;restlessness;seizure;sex difference;skin disease;somnolence;speech disorder;suicide;urine retention;vertigo,,

Compared with drug trials, obtaining DDI information from scientific articles is a faster and lower cost but still a highly credible approach. However, current DDI text extraction methods consider the instances generated from articles to be independent and ignore the potential connections between different instances in the same article or sentence. Effective use of external text data could improve prediction accuracy, but existing methods cannot extract key information from external data accurately and reasonably, resulting in low utilization of external data. In this study, we propose a DDI extraction framework, instance position embedding and key external text for DDI (IK-DDI), which adopts instance position embedding and key external text to extract DDI information. The proposed framework integrates the article-level and sentence-level position information of the instances into the model to strengthen the connections between instances generated from the same article or sentence. Moreover, we introduce a comprehensive similarity-matching method that uses string and word sense similarity to improve the matching accuracy between the target drug and external text. Furthermore, the key sentence search method is used to obtain key information from external data. Therefore, IK-DDI can make full use of the connection between instances and the information contained in external text data to improve the efficiency of DDI extraction. Experimental results show that IK-DDI outperforms existing methods on both macro-averaged and micro-averaged metrics, which suggests our method provides complete framework that can be used to extract relationships between biomedical entities and process external text data.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Dados de bases não oficiais",10.1093/bib/bbad099,benchmarking;data mining;drug delivery system;drug interaction;pharmacovigilance;procedures,,

We aimed to analyze the RASI-related AKI or hyperkalemia reported in the Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database to optimize patients' treatment and provide a reference for a clinically safe and rational prescription. Methods: We obtained data in FAERS recorded from January 2004 to December 2020. Disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis were used in data mining to screen the suspected AKI or hyperkalemia after RASI. The time to onset, hospitalization, and prognosis of RASI-associated AKI or hyperkalemia were also investigated. Results: We identified 11,301 RASI-related adverse events (AEs) of hyperkalemia and AKI in the FAERS database; 4997 were due to Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), 5658 were due to angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and 646 were due to the combination of ACEI and ARB. AKI was more commonly reported in patients with ARB (78.42%) than ACEI users (57.27%). Hyperkalemia cases were reported more in ACEI users (28.70%) than ARB users (14.14%). The median time to onset of RAS-associated AKI was 135.0 (17.0-620.0) days. RASI-associated hyperkalemia occurred relatively later in ACEI users, with a median onset time of 261.0 (43.0-1097.7) days, compared with that of 200.5 (52.0-636.0) days in ARB users (p < 0.001). Among all AEs, 72.39% of cases received hospitalization. Death occurred in 6.3% of the renal AE cases. The elderly and heart failure were potential risk factors for death in patients who developed RASI-associated renal AEs, with an increased Odds Ratio (OR) compared with younger age (OR = 1.32) and hypertension patients (OR = 2.55). Based on the criteria of the four algorithms, the ACEI and ARB combination further increased the incidence of AKI and hyperkalemia, demonstrating the highest Reporting Odds Ratios (RORs), Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRRs) and Empirical Bayesian Geometric Average (EBGMs). Conclusions: Patients who indicated RASI for heart failure demonstrated a higher death risk when AEs occurred. ACEI combined with ARB can increase the incidence of hyperkalemia and AKI. Careful and individualized management is necessary.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: G.

Research design and methods: We performed a disproportionality analysis based on the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2020. Renal injury cases were defined as acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) cases. Results: We detected a significant association between ARNI, SGLT-2Is, the combination therapy and AKI as well as CKD, in which the combination therapy generated the highest strength association with both AKI (ROR: 8.06, 95% CI 5.41–12.01) and CKD (ROR: 2.69, 95% CI 1.27–5.71). Compared with ARNI or SGLT-2I alone, the combination therapy generated AKI signals. There were no differences in the onset time of renal injury cases between the combination therapy and monotherapy. Compared to cases without renal injury, the combination therapy did not increase the proportion of fatality and hospitalizations in cases with AKI or CKD. Conclusion: The combination of ARNI and SGLT-2Is was associated with a significantly increased reporting proportion of AKI.

This study aimed to construct a new triage system using longitudinal data for drug-safety signal detection, integrating datamining tools, and evaluate adaptability of such system. Patients and Methods: Based on relevant guidelines and structural frameworks in Taiwan’s pharmacovigilance system, we constructed a triage system integrating sequence symmetry analysis (SSA) and tree-based scan statistics (TreeScan) as data-mining tools for detecting safety signals. We conducted an exploratory analysis utilizing Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Database and selecting two drug classes (sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and non-fluorinated quinolones (NFQ)) as chronic and episodic treatment respectively, as examples to test feasibility of the system. Results: Under the proposed system, either cohort-based or self-controlled mining with SSA and TreeScan was selected, based on whether the screened drug had an appropriate comparator. All detected alerts were further classified as known adverse drug reactions (ADRs), events related to other causes or potential signals from the triage algorithm, building on existing drug labels and clinical judgement. Exploratory analysis revealed greater numbers of signals for NFQ with a relatively low proportion of known ADRs; most were related to indication, patient characteristics or bias. No safety signals were found. By contrast, most SGLT2i signals were known ADRs or events related to patient characteristics. Four were potential signals warranting further investigation. Conclusion: The proposed system facilitated active and systematic screening to detect and classify potential safety signals. Countries with real-world longitudinal data could adopt it to streamline drug-safety surveillance.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: E.C.-C.

We characterize the statistical power of TreeScan, a data mining tool, to identify potential signals in the setting of perinatal medication exposures and infant outcomes. Methods: We used empirical data to inform background incidence of major congenital malformations and other birth conditions. Statistical power was calculated using two probability models compatible with TreeScan, Bernoulli and Poisson, while varying the sample size, magnitude of the risk increase, and incidence of a specified outcome. We also simulated larger referent to exposure matching ratios when using the Bernoulli model in the setting of fixed N:1 propensity score matching. Finally, we assessed the impact of outcome misclassification on power. Results: The Poisson model demonstrated greater power to detect signals than the Bernoulli model across all scenarios and suggested a sample size of 4,000 exposed pregnancies is needed to detect a twofold increase in risk of a common outcome (approximately 8 per 1,000) with 85% power. Increasing the fixed matching ratio with the Bernoulli model did not reliably increase power. An outcome definition with high sensitivity is expected to have somewhat greater power to detect signals than an outcome definition with high positive predictive value. Conclusions: Use of the Poisson model with an outcome definition that prioritizes sensitivity may be optimal for signal detection. TreeScan is a viable method for surveillance of adverse infant outcomes following maternal medication use.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza DM,Naõ utiliza bases oficiais | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Dados simulados",10.1097/EDE.0000000000001561,adolescent;adult;article;child;congenital malformation;data mining;drug monitoring;drug safety;female;human;incidence;infant;intermethod comparison;perinatal drug exposure;predictive value;pregnancy;statistics;study design;TreeScan statistics,,

However, the safety profile of the whole TKIs induced ILD was largely unknown. Research design and methods: The reported cases of ILD associated with TKIs were downloaded from the FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS) database between 1 January 2004 and 30 April 2022 to detect ILD signals by disproportionality analysis. Furthermore, the fatality rate and time to onset (TTO) of various TKIs were also calculated. Results: The median age of total 2999 reported cases was 67. The largest reported cases came from osimertinib (n = 736, 24.5%). However, gefitinib had the highest ROR of 12.47 (11.4, 13.64) and IC of 3.53 (3.23, 3.86), means the strongest association with ILD. Trametinib, vemurafenib, larotectinib, selpercatinib, and cabozantinib did not show ILD signal.

This study assessed the adverse events (AEs) associated with upadacitinib by mining data from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Methods: Disproportionality analyses, including the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), and the multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS) algorithms, were employed to quantify the signals of upadacitinib-associated AEs. Results: A total of 3,837,420 reports of AEs were collected from the FAERS database, of which 4494 reports were identified with upadacitinib as the “primary suspect (PS)”. Upadacitinib-induced AEs occurrence targeted 27 system organ clases (SOCs). A total of 200 significant disproportionality PTs conforming to the four algorithms were simultaneously retained. Unexpected significant AEs, such as arthralgia, musculoskeletal stiffness, diverticulitis, and cataract might also occur. The median onset time of upadacitinib-associated AEs was 65 days (interquartile range [IQR] 21–182 days), and most of the onsets occurred within the first 1, 2, 3, and 4 months after initiation of upadacitinib.

This unprecedented crisis has led to a surge of online discussions about potential cures for the disease. Among them, vaccines have been at the heart of the debates and have faced lack of confidence before marketing in France. Objective: This study aims to identify and investigate the opinions of French Twitter users on the announced vaccines against COVID-19 through sentiment analysis. Methods: This study was conducted in 2 phases. First, we filtered a collection of tweets related to COVID-19 available on Twitter from February 2020 to August 2020 with a set of keywords associated with vaccine mistrust using word embeddings. Second, we performed sentiment analysis using deep learning to identify the characteristics of vaccine mistrust. The model was trained on a hand-labeled subset of 4548 tweets. Results: A set of 69 relevant keywords were identified as the semantic concept of the word “vaccin” (vaccine in French) and focused mainly on conspiracies, pharmaceutical companies, and alternative treatments. Those keywords enabled us to extract nearly 350,000 tweets in French. The sentiment analysis model achieved 0.75 accuracy. The model then predicted 16% of positive tweets, 41% of negative tweets, and 43% of neutral tweets. This allowed us to explore the semantic concepts of positive and negative tweets and to plot the trends of each sentiment. The main negative rhetoric identified from users’ tweets was that vaccines are perceived as having a political purpose and that COVID-19 is a commercial argument for the pharmaceutical companies. Conclusions: Twitter might be a useful tool to investigate the arguments for vaccine mistrust because it unveils political criticism contrasting with the usual concerns on adverse drug reactions. As the opposition rhetoric is more consistent and more widely spread than the positive rhetoric, we believe that this research provides effective tools to help health authorities better characterize the risk of vaccine mistrust.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza DM,Excluído - Usa dados de Vacinas | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Vacinas",10.2196/37237,article;azithromycin;Bayesian network;comparative study;content analysis;coronavirus disease 2019;deep learning;distrust;drug marketing;embedding;France;human;hydroxychloroquine;ivermectin;prediction;public opinion;qualitative analysis;risk;SARS-CoV-2 vaccine;semantics;sentiment analysis;social media;social media monitoring;vaccination;vaccination reaction;vaccine hesitancy;word embedding,,

We conducted this pharmacovigilance analysis to research cardiac arrhythmias associated with ALK-TKIs using the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Research design and methods: The first ALK-TKI, named crizotinib, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 26 August 2011 for the treatment of ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We evaluated ALK-TKIs-induced cardiac arrhythmias, by using the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information component (IC) for mining the adverse event report signals in the FAERS database between January 2016 and June 2022. Results: We identified a total of 362 ALK-TKIs-related cardiac arrhythmia reports which appeared to influence more men (64.44%) than women (30.76%), with a median age of 68 (interquartile range [IQR] 7–74) years. Compared with the full database, ALK-TKIs were detected with pharmacovigilance of cardiac arrhythmias (ROR025 = 1.26, IC025 = 0.26). Crizotinib and alectinib were found to be related to higher reporting of arrhythmias. The median time to onset (TTO) among five ALK-TKI therapies was significantly different (p = 0.044). Conclusion: ALK-TKIs present different frequencies of cardiac arrhythmias reporting, with only crizotinib and alectinib producing positive signals in high-level group term (HLGT) level arrhythmia. The time interval between the initial of drug treatment to the onset of arrhythmia varies greatly and cannot be predicted.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.1080/14740338.2023.2234279,adolescent;adult;aged;alectinib;anaplastic lymphoma kinase;anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitor;article;atrial fibrillation;bradycardia;brigatinib;cancer chemotherapy;ceritinib;child;complete heart block;controlled study;crizotinib;data base;data mining;fatality;female;Food and Drug Administration;gene rearrangement;heart arrest;heart arrhythmia;heart atrium flutter;heart ventricle fibrillation;human;long QT syndrome;lorlatinib;major clinical study;male;non small cell lung cancer;pharmacovigilance;prognosis;respiratory arrest;signal detection;sinus bradycardia;sinus node disease;sinus tachycardia;sudden cardiac death;tachycardia;time,,

Methods: We collected data from FAERS from January 2004 to November 2022 and mined AE signals for Dmab and ZA using ROR values. We compared signal intensity for same AEs and investigated off-label use. We also examined their AEs in adjuvant therapy for breast and prostate cancer. Results: 154,735 reports of primary suspect drugs were analyzed in the FAERS database (Dmab: 117,857; ZA: 36,878). Dmab and ZA had 333 and 1,379 AE signals, with 189 overlaps. The AEs of Dmab included death (ROR:3.478), osteonecrosis of jaw (ROR:53.025), back pain (ROR:2.432), tooth disorder (ROR:16.18), bone pain (ROR:6.523). For ZA, the AEs included osteonecrosis (ROR:104.866), death (ROR: 3.645), pain (ROR:3.963), osteonecrosis of jaw (ROR: 91.744), tooth extraction (ROR: 142.143). Among overlap signals, Dmab showed higher strength in exostosis of the jaw (ROR: 182.66 vs. 5.769), atypical fractures (ROR: 55.589 vs. 9.123), and atypical femur fractures (ROR:49.824 vs. 4.968). And ZA exhibited stronger associations in abscess jaw (ROR: 84.119 vs. 11.12), gingival ulceration (ROR: 74.125 vs. 4.827), increased bone formation (ROR: 69.344 vs. 3.218). Additionally, we identified 528 off-label uses for Dmab and 206 for ZA, with Dmab mainly used in prostate cancer (1.04%), breast cancer (1.03%), and arthritis (0.42%), while ZA in breast cancer (3.21%), prostate cancer (2.48%), and neoplasm malignant (0.52%). For Dmab in breast cancer treatment, AEs included death (11.6%), disease progression (3.3%), and neutropenia (2.7%), while for ZA included death (19.8%), emotional disorder (12.9%), osteomyelitis (11.7%). For prostate cancer treatment, Dmab`s AEs were death (8.9%), prostate cancer metastatic (1.6%), renal impairment (1.7%), while ZA`s included death (34.4%), general physical health deterioration (19.9%), and hemoglobin decreased (18.9%). Conclusion: Our analysis of FAERS database provided postmarketing surveillance data and revealed different strengths of reported AE signals between Dmab and ZA in some of their common AEs. It’s also worth noting that both drugs have potential off-label applications, which could introduce new AEs. This highlights the necessity for safety monitoring when using Dmab and ZA off-label.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: J.

Preferred Terms of ADR reports were categorized by System Organ Class (SOC) based on the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Results: This study retrieved 12,221 cases within the reporting period. A total of 140 repetitive signals were obtained by ROR and PRR, of which 53 new ADR signals were not recorded in the drug labels/datasheets. The top three ADR reports were “blood creatine phosphokinase elevation” (ROR, 56.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 51.07–62.87, PRR 51.94), “eosinophilic pneumonia” (ROR 696.71, 95%CI 603.21–804.70, PRR 657.57), and “rhabdomyolysis” (ROR 22.85, 95%CI 19.94–26.18, PRR 21.83). The highest ROR of “antimicrobial susceptibility test resistant” was found at 9808.14. Reports of rare adverse events, such as “necrotizing fasciitis and compartment syndrome,” have emerged. The significant SOCs were “Infections and Infestations” and “Investigations.” Conclusion: New daptomycin ADR signals were detected. Clinicians should monitor these potential ADRs in patients receiving daptomycin.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.1007/s11096-022-01472-x,acute kidney failure;acute lung injury;acute myeloid leukemia;allergic pneumonitis;antibiotic resistance;antibiotic sensitivity;aortic regurgitation;aortic valve disease;article;bacteremia;bacterial arthritis;bacterial endocarditis;brain disease;candidiasis;chill;cholestasis;Clostridium infection;compartment syndrome;creatine kinase;creatine kinase blood level;creatinine;cubicin;daptomycin;data mining;diskitis;DRESS syndrome;drug eruption;drug labeling;drug safety;drug-induced liver injury;embolism;endocarditis;enterococcal infection;eosinophilia;epidural abscess;Escherichia coli infection;fever;Food and Drug Administration;fungemia;geotrichosis;heart valve abscess;heart ventricle tachycardia;hemophagocytic syndrome;human;hyperkalemia;hyperoxaluria;infection;infectious arthritis;infestation;interstitial nephritis;kidney disease;kidney tubule necrosis;lactic acidosis;liver cell damage;Loeffler pneumonia;lung infiltrate;lung mycosis;mediastinum disease;mental deficiency;multiple organ failure;myocarditis;myopathy;myositis;necrotizing fasciitis;odds ratio;oliguria;papule;patient monitoring;pharmacovigilance;postmarketing surveillance;prescription;Pseudomonas infection;rash;respiratory failure;respiratory tract disease;rhabdomyolysis;seizure;sepsis;septic shock;side effect;skin disease;staphylococcal bacteremia;Staphylococcus infection;supraventricular tachycardia;thorax disease;thrombocytopenia;thrombophlebitis;toxic myopathy;United States;valvular heart disease,,

However, limited by the study population, the association between asparaginase and DKA has not been elucidated. The purpose of this study was to determine the potential association between asparaginase and DKA and analyse related clinical characteristics and possible risk factor. Methods: Disproportionality analysis with the reporting odd ratio (ROR) was used to detect the adverse reaction signals of asparaginase-associated DKA in Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). A literature review was conducted to further analyse clinical characteristics, possible risk factor and something noteworthy in asparaginase-associated DKA. Results and Discussion: A total of 12 reports of DKA associated with l-asparaginase (l-asp) and 6 reports associated with pegaspargase (PEG-asp) were extracted in FAERS, more than 50% of the cases were classified as serious adverse events. DKA was a positive signal of l-asp (ROR = 2.397, 95% CI 1.360–4.226), while not closely related to the use of PEG-asp (ROR = 1.602, 95% CI 0.719–3.570). Searched in PubMed, Embase and Web of Science, a total of eight patients were collected. The patients were mainly adolescent patients, aged between 11 and 25 years old with a median age of 16 years. Drug dosage form distribution is unbalanced, 7 patients received l-asp and only 1 received PEG-asp. What is New and Conclusions: The ROR of KDA caused by l-asp was statistically significant, but there was not a statistical association for DKA caused by PEG-asp. Asparaginase dosage form may affect the occurrence of DKA, but further research is needed.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: Q.

Several studies evaluated SGLT2 inhibitor-related acute kidney injury (AKI), but pharmacoepidemiology studies are needed to compare the adverse events in different SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). Methods: We used disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis in data mining to screen the AKI cases after initiating different SGLT2i among diabetic patients, based on the FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) updated to December 2020. We also investigated the onset time and fatality rates of SGLT2i-associated AKI, which was based on preferred terms (PTs) coded for the renal adverse events in the structure of the FARES database. Results: We identified 2483 cases of AKI following SGLT2i regimens among diabetic patients. Most of them were 45–64 years old (58.46%) and > 65 years old (28.67%). Canagliflozin generated the largest number of AKI reports (n = 1650, 66.45%) in our study. Canagliflozin showed the strongest association among SGLT2i, evidenced by the highest reporting odds ratio (ROR = 3.70, two-sided 95% CI 3.51–3.91), proportional reporting ratio (PRR = 3.39, χ2 = 2635.06), and empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM = 3.18, one-sided 95% CI 3.04). The median onset time to AKI was 72.0 (interquartile range [IQR] 21.0–266.0) days after SGLT2i initiation. The general hospitalization rate of SGLT2i-associated AKI was 63.50%, and the fatality rate was 1.59%. The deceased patients (62.94 ± 10.69 years) were significantly older than the survived ones (57.82 ± 11.84 years) (P = 0.011). Conclusion: We compared AKI events in the real-world practice of various SGLT2i among diabetic cases from the FAERS database. It is essential to monitor kidney function during the early administration of SGLT2i. Concern should be paid for AKI in patients older than 65 taking SGLT2i.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.1007/s11255-022-03211-7,acute kidney failure;adult;adverse drug reaction;aged;article;Bayes theorem;canagliflozin;canagliflozin plus metformin;creatinine;creatinine blood level;dapagliflozin;dapagliflozin plus metformin;dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin;data mining;diabetes mellitus;diabetic nephropathy;diabetic patient;empagliflozin;empagliflozin plus linagliptin;ertugliflozin plus metformin;estimated glomerular filtration rate;female;hospitalization;human;ICD-10;interstitial nephritis;kidney injury;major clinical study;male;mortality rate;non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus;peritoneal dialysis;pharmacovigilance;phylogeny;renin angiotensin aldosterone system;saxagliptin;sitagliptin;sodium glucose cotransporter 2;sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor;treatment outcome,,

First, using the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database, we evaluated the association between voriconazole use and cSCC in Japan. Second, using the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, we examined regional differences in the occurrence of voriconazole-induced cSCC between Japan and other countries. We calculated reporting odds ratios (RORs) as disproportionality analysis to evaluate voriconazole-induced cSCC. In this study, cases in which one or more of ""Bowen's disease"", ""Carcinoma in situ of skin"", ""Keratoacanthoma"", ""Squamous cell carcinoma in skin"", or ""Squamous cell carcinoma"" were reported as adverse events were considered to be cSCC cases.

However, it remains unclear whether age is a risk factor for immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Materials and methods: To analyze the association between irAEs and age based on data from the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database between January 2004 and December 2020, we performed a case/noncase study on ICI-related adverse events. Cases were defined as adverse event cases with ICI therapy and irAEs, and noncases were defined as adverse event cases with ICI therapy and without irAEs. One case was matched to a noncase using the sex, reporter, report year, and type of ICI regimen. The reporting odds ratios (RORs) were used to assess the disproportionality of irAEs between older adults (≥65 years) and younger adults (<65 years). Results: The study shows that compared with younger adults, the ROR of older adults was 1.12 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08–1.16) and 1.18 (95% CI: 1.14–1.23) before and after matching, respectively. The signal of age-related irAEs was detected in patients treated with ICI monotherapy but not in patients treated with combination therapy. Further analysis revealed a spectrum of age-related toxicities including cardiovascular toxicities, lung toxicities, musculoskeletal toxicities, nervous system toxicities, renal toxicities, and skin toxicities. Conclusion: In this analysis performed based on the FAERS, irAE cases were more likely to be reported in older adults. Our pharmacovigilance study complements the safety data of clinical trials. Further studies are expected to explore the underlying reasons for irAEs in older adults.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.1016/j.jgo.2022.05.009,adult;adverse event;age;aged;article;atezolizumab;avelumab;cardiovascular disease;cemiplimab;confidence interval;data mining;drug dose regimen;durvalumab;endocrine disease;eye disease;female;Food and Drug Administration;gastrointestinal disease;hematologic disease;human;immune checkpoint inhibitor;immune related adverse event;immune response;ipilimumab;kidney disease;liver disease;lung disease;male;monotherapy;musculoskeletal disease;neurologic disease;nivolumab;odds ratio;patient-reported outcome;pembrolizumab;pharmacovigilance;risk factor;sensitivity analysis;sex;skin disease,,

No large-scale analysis of UK data has been attempted. This retrospective descriptive study aimed to estimate the prevalence of hard limit events and to estimate the potential severity of DERS events. Method Twelve months of DERS data was obtained from two NHS trusts in England. Definitions for drug categories and clinical areas were standardised and an algorithm developed to extract hard maximum (HMX) events. Subject matter experts (SMEs) were asked to rate severity of all HMX events on a scale of 0 (no harm) to 10 (death). These were analysed by clinical area and drug category, per 1000 administrations. Results A total of 745 170 infusions were administered over 644 052 patient bed days (PBDs). 45% of these (338 263) were administered with DERS enabled. HMX event incidence across the whole dataset was 17.9/1000 administrations (95% CI 17.5 to 18.4); 9.4/1000 PBDs (95% CI 9.2 to 9.7). 6067 HMX events were identified. 4604 were <2-fold deviations and excluded. HMX were identified in all drug categories. The highest incidence was antibacterial drugs (2.21%; 95% CI 2.13 to 2.29). Of the 1415 HMX events reviewed by SMEs, 747 (52.6%) were low/no harm. Drugs with greatest potential harm were antiarrhythmics (21.8/1000 administrations; 95% CI 16.3 to 29.1), parenteral anticoagulants (24.16/1000 administrations; 95% CI 15.3 to 37.9) and antiepileptics (20.86/1000 administrations; 95% CI 16.4 to 26.5). DERS has prevented severe harm or death in 110 patients in these hospitals. Medical and paediatric areas had higher prevalence of potentially harmful HMX events, but these were probably related to profile design. Conclusion Compliance with DERS in this study was 45%. DERS events are common, but potential harm is rare. DERS events are not related to specific clinical areas. There are some issues with definition and design of drug profiles that may cause DERS events, thus future work should focus on implementation and data standardisation for future large-scale analysis.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: A.

Aim To evaluate the association of DILI with tetracycline antibiotics. Method All DILI cases of tetracycline antibiotics as primary suspected drugs were extracted from the US Food and Drug Administration adverse event reporting system (FAERS). The outcomes included severe DILI, hepatocellular injury, cholestatic injury, and liver failure. Disproportionality analyses were conducted by estimating the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and the information component (IC). Results A total of 1,435 liver injury cases associated with tetracycline antibiotics were identified. The DILI signal was detected in tigecycline, minocycline, and doxycycline. The RORs and the 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of tigecycline, minocycline, and doxycycline were (ROR 5.85, 95% CI 4.96–6.91), (ROR 6.4, 95% CI 5.76–7.11), and (ROR 2.07, 95% CI 1.86–2.31), respectively.

Rapid response and immediate care are considered in agile emergency care. Artificial intelligence (AI) and informatics have been applied to fulfill these requirements through automated emergency technology. Machine learning (ML) is one of the main parts of some of these proposed technologies. There are various ML algorithms and techniques which are potentially applicable for different purposes of emergency care. AI-based approaches using classification and clustering algorithms, natural language processing, and text mining are some of the possible techniques that could prove useful for investigating models of emergency prevention and management and proposing improved procedures for handling such critical situations. ML is known as a field of AI which attempts to automatically learn from data and applies that learning to make better decisions. Decision-support tools can apply the results of either supervised or various semi-supervised or unsupervised learning methods to tackle the how decisions about emergency situations are typically handled by the best professionals at the scene of an emergency, in the pre-hospital, and in healthcare facility settings. Enhanced and rapid communication at the moment of emergency, with the most effective decision making for triaging to estimate the acute nature of injuries and possible complications, how to keep a patient stable on the way to the care facility, and also avoiding adverse drug reactions, are some of the possible directions for exploring how ML can help to gather the data and to make emergency management more efficient and effective. The wide range of scenarios present in emergency situations and the complexity of different legal and ethical constraints on what responding personnel are allowed to perform on an injured subject before reaching a hospital makes for a most challenging set of problems for investigating the components of ""intelligent"" decision support that could help in these highly interactive and humanly tragic situations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza DM,Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Não é estudo original",10.3233/SHTI220003,algorithm;artificial intelligence;data mining;human;machine learning;natural language processing,,

Like any other drug, vaccines may cause unexpected side effects, which need to be investigated in a timely manner to minimize harm in the population. If not properly dealt with, side effects may also impact public trust in the vaccination campaigns carried out by national governments. Objective: Monitoring social media for the early identification of side effects, and understanding the public opinion on the vaccines are of paramount importance to ensure a successful and harmless rollout. The objective of this study was to create a web portal to monitor the opinion of social media users on COVID-19 vaccines, which can offer a tool for journalists, scientists, and users alike to visualize how the general public is reacting to the vaccination campaign. Methods: We developed a tool to analyze the public opinion on COVID-19 vaccines from Twitter, exploiting, among other techniques, a state-of-the-art system for the identification of adverse drug events on social media; natural language processing models for sentiment analysis; statistical tools; and open-source databases to visualize the trending hashtags, news articles, and their factuality. All modules of the system are displayed through an open web portal. Results: A set of 650,000 tweets was collected and analyzed in an ongoing process that was initiated in December 2020. The results of the analysis are made public on a web portal (updated daily), together with the processing tools and data. The data provide insights on public opinion about the vaccines and its change over time. For example, users show a high tendency to only share news from reliable sources when discussing COVID-19 vaccines (98% of the shared URLs). The general sentiment of Twitter users toward the vaccines is negative/neutral; however, the system is able to record fluctuations in the attitude toward specific vaccines in correspondence with specific events (eg, news about new outbreaks). The data also show how news coverage had a high impact on the set of discussed topics. To further investigate this point, we performed a more in-depth analysis of the data regarding the AstraZeneca vaccine. We observed how media coverage of blood clot-related side effects suddenly shifted the topic of public discussions regarding both the AstraZeneca and other vaccines. This became particularly evident when visualizing the most frequently discussed symptoms for the vaccines and comparing them month by month. Conclusions: We present a tool connected with a web portal to monitor and display some key aspects of the public's reaction to COVID-19 vaccines. The system also provides an overview of the opinions of the Twittersphere through graphic representations, offering a tool for the extraction of suspected adverse events from tweets with a deep learning model.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza DM,Excluído - Usa dados de Vacinas | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Vacinas",10.2196/35115,ad 26cov 2s vaccine;allergy;anaphylaxis;article;blood clot;blood clotting;coronavac;coronavirus disease 2019;data base;data processing;elasomeran;epidemic;fever;headache;human;ibacovavec;Internet;misinformation;natural language processing;pandemic;public opinion;SARS-CoV-2 vaccine;sentiment analysis;sinopharm covid 19 vaccine;social media;sputnik v vaccine;thromboembolism;thrombosis;tozinameran;unclassified drug;vaccination;vaxzevria;videorecording,,

Methods: We performed disproportionality and Bayesian analyses based on data from the first quarter in 2004 to the third quarter in 2021 in the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System to characterize the signal differences of antifungal drugs-related DILI. We also compared the onset time and mortality differences of different antifungal agents. Results: A total of 2943 antifungal drugs-related DILI were identified. Affected patients tended to be aged >45 years (51.38%), with more males than females (49.03% vs. 38.09%). Antifungal drug-induced liver injury is most commonly reported with voriconazole (32.45%), fluconazole (19.37%), and itraconazole (14.51%). Almost all antifungal drugs were shown to be associated with DILI under disproportionality and Bayesian analyses. The intraclass analysis of correlation between different antifungal agents and DILI showed the following ranking: caspofungin (ROR = 6.12; 95%CI: 5.36–6.98) > anidulafungin (5.15; 3.69–7.18) > itraconazole (5.06; 4.58–5.60) > voriconazole (4.58; 4.29–4.90) > micafungin (4.53; 3.89–5.27) > posaconazole (3.99; 3.47–4.59) > fluconazole (3.19; 2.93–3.47) > ketoconazole (2.28; 1.96–2.64). The onset time of DILI was significantly different among different antifungal drugs (p < 0.0001), and anidulafungin result in the highest mortality rate (50.00%), while ketoconazole has the lowest mortality rate (9.60%). Conclusion: Based on the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database, antifungal drugs are significantly associated with DILI, and itraconazole and voriconazole had the greatest risk of liver injury.

Methods: Disproportionality analyses, including the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), and the multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS) algorithms, were employed to quantify the signals of axitinib-associated AEs. Results: Out of 10,703,806 reports collected from the FAERS database, 9044 reports of axitinib as the ‘primary suspected (PS)’ AEs were identified. Axitinib induced AEs occurrence targeted 26 organ systems. A total of 95 significant disproportionality PTs conforming to the four algorithms were simultaneously retained. Rare reports and significant signals of aortic disease have emerged. Unexpected significant AEs such as scrotal swelling, scrotal ulcers, infections, and infestations might also occur. The median onset time of axitinib-associated AEs was 63.5 days (interquartile range [IQR] 20–182 days), and most of the cases occurred within the first one and 2 months after axitinib initiation.

Diabetes has been reported to be a risk factor for lowering androgen levels. Moreover, lowered androgen levels are more common in older men. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the signals for gynecomastia in older men on antidiabetic medications. Materials and methods: A disproportionality analysis was performed to detect the signals for antidiabetic drug-associated gynecomastia in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database (JADER), using the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information component (IC).

Dupilumab, the first biologic approved for atopic dermatitis, showed excellent effects on improving pruritus and sleep after only two weeks of treatment but, in some cases, may have paradoxical effects. The rate of sleep-related side-effects remains unknown. More specifically, adverse-drug reactions (ADRs) related to dupilumab have been investigated during the safety phase of randomized clinical trials or in small retrospective epidemiological surveys, but little is known about sleep-related ADRs in real-life settings. Therefore, we took advantage of a global largescale pharmacovigilance database, carrying out a comprehensive data mining analysis to look at different sleep-related ADRs reported among patients under anti IL-4/13 therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed individual case study reports (ICSRs) in VigiBaseTM, the World Health Organization (WHO) global pharmacovigilance database of ADRs collected by national drug authorities in > 140 countries (> 90% of the world population). We looked for patterns of potentially sleep-related ADRs and we applied a disproportionality analysis based on Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN). A meta-analytical approach was used to synthesize the overall effect size of sleep-related ADRs potentially associated to Dupilumab administration. RESULTS: From inception up to March 9, 2021, 94,065 ADRs from 37,848 unique reports were included and analyzed in the present paper: 1,294 of them (1.4%) concerned sleep disturbances (n=27). Most of sleep-related complaints were generic sleep disorders (n=630), followed by insomnia (n=312), somnolence (n=81), lethargy (n=60), night sweats (n=30), middle insomnia (n=39), hypersomnia (n=25), poor-quality sleep (n=21), initial insomnia (n=17), sleep apnea syndrome (n=13), nightmares (n=11) and sleep deficit (n=11). Interestingly, restlessness and restless leg syndrome, nocturnal dyspnea, narcolepsy and bruxism were reported in 7, 6, 5, 4 and 3 cases, respectively. Only sleep deficit [OR 15.67 (95% CrI 8.61-28.51); IC 3.24 (95% CrI 2.26-3.97)], generic sleep disorder [OR 6.22 (95% CrI 5.74-6.73); IC 2.60 (95% CrI 2.48-2.71)], nocturnal dyspnea [OR 3.68 (95% CrI 1.53-8.87); IC 1.56 (95% CrI 0.03-2.56)] and middle insomnia [OR 1.87 (95% CrI 1.36-2.56); IC 0.88 (95% CrI 0.39-1.30)] achieved the statistical significance threshold. CONCLUSIONS: In this work, we identified over 37,000 unique case-reports of Dupilumab side-effects reported on the WHO pharmacovigilance database. We specifically categorized those related to sleep issues, which were 1,294. Our findings from large numbers of cases provide data supporting the clinical observations that Dupilumab is usually effective in improving sleep quality and sleep disturbances/ impairments, given the lack of statistical significance of several sleep-related ADRs. Further work is needed to closely scrutinize the impact of Dupilumab on sleep, in terms of underlying mechanisms, and to better understand residual sleep disorders in patients with atopic dermatitis and other allergic diseases treated with Dupilumab. Thus, sleep monitoring may be helpful for dermatologists in managing atopic dermatitis patients treated with dupilumab. The limitations of spontaneous reporting systems including underreporting and reporting bias, heterogeneity of sources and impossibility to infer any causal relationship merit consideration and further research is needed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.26355/eurrev_202206_28977,apnea hypopnea index;article;atopic dermatitis;Beck Anxiety Inventory;big data;bruxism;clinical observation;coping;data base;data mining;dermatologist;drug response;drug safety;dupilumab;dyspnea;effect size;human;hypersomnia;insomnia;lethargy;machine learning;machine learning software;narcolepsy;night sweat;nightmare;personalized medicine;pharmacoepidemiology;pharmacovigilance;polysomnography;reporting bias;restless legs syndrome;restlessness;sleep apnea syndromes;sleep debt;sleep disorder;sleep quality;somnolence;statistical significance;VigiBase;World Health Organization,,

It is known that drospirenone causes small increased risk of gallbladder diseases. However, the risk may vary between different adverse drug reaction databases. Objective: The purpose of this studty is to examine the safety and risk association between hormonal contraceptive drospirenone and gallbladder diseases using adverse drug reaction database of USFDA’s Federal Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS), Europe’s Eudravigilance (EV) and Canada’s Canada Vigilance Adverse Reaction Online Database (CVARD). Methods: Individual Case Safety Reports of patients till October 2019 were downloaded from the Federal Adverse Event Reporting System, Eudravigilance, and Canadian database. These reports contained information on adverse events associated with all other drugs inclusive of drospirenone. The disproportionality method of data mining was used to calculate the risk association. Results: The lower limit of 95% CI of PRR was 3.27, 3.47 and 3.76, PRR was 33.08, 41.35 and 115.42, ROR was 37.20, 44.61 and 127.19, Chi-square value was 126572.89, 110392.95 and 362.46, and IC-2SD value was 0.16, 0.17, and 1.21 for FAERS, EU, and CVARD respectively indicating a week signal.

Results: Among 1,194,189 varicella vaccinees with no other same-day vaccinations, nine diagnoses with clustering features were categorized into four safety signals: fever on days 1–6 (attributable risk [AR] 38.5 per 100,000, p < 0.001), gastritis and duodenitis on days 1–2 (AR 5.9 per 100,000, p < 0.001), acute upper respiratory infection on days 1–5 (AR 11.0 per 100,000, p = 0.006), and varicella infection on days 1–9 (AR 2.7 per 100,000, p < 0.001). These safety profiles and their corresponding risk intervals have been identified in previous safety surveillance studies. Conclusions: Unexpected clusters of AEs were not detected after the mass administration of childhood varicella vaccines in Taiwan. The tree-temporal statistical method is a feasible approach to the safety surveillance of vaccines in populations of young children.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Usa dados de Vacinas | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Vacinas",10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.09.035,article;chickenpox;chickenpox vaccine;child;data mining;drug monitoring;drug safety;duodenitis;feasibility study;female;fever;gastritis;human;infant;major clinical study;male;preschool child;risk factor;temporal analysis;tree temporal scan analysis;upper respiratory tract infection;vaccination,,

Materials: This retrospective study described the general characteristics of adverse drug event (ADE) reports related to carbapenems in the FAERS during 2015 - 2018. Methods: The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the reporting odds ratio (ROR), and information component (IC) of Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) were calculated to identify potential safety signals. Results: A total number of 5,899 reports associated with carbapenems were submitted to the FAERS from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2018. The most frequently reported ADE associated with carbapenems was drug ineffective (10.51%). Serious ADEs and death associated with carbapenems were reported in 41.24 and 25.12%, respectively. Infections and infestations was the strongest signal detected in both meropenem and imipenem. Nervous system disorders and psychiatric disorders were strongly detected in ertapenem. Hepatobiliary disorders were common in doripenem patients. Conclusion: Carbapenem resistance is alarming in the United States, and carbapenem is more likely to be associated with serious and fatal ADEs among β-lactam antibiotics. Both differences and similarities exist in the safety profile among carbapenems classes. Close attention should be paid to patients with special disease when administrated carbapenems.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.5414/CP203811,adult;alkaline phosphatase;alkaline phosphatase blood level;article;back propagation neural network;brain disease;candidiasis;Clostridium infection;confidence interval;confusion;consumer;controlled study;data mining;data processing;delirium;doripenem;DRESS syndrome;drug eruption;drug safety;epilepsy;ertapenem;esophagitis;female;fever;Food and Drug Administration;fungemia;hallucination;health practitioner;herpes simplex;histiocytosis;human;imipenem;infectious agent;Klebsiella infection;liver disease;liver failure;major clinical study;male;meropenem;multiple organ failure;myoclonus;neurologic disease;neurotoxicity;neutrophil count;odds ratio;pharmacist;pharmacovigilance;physician;QT prolongation;retrospective study;seizure;sepsis;side effect;skin toxicity;superinfection;toxic epidermal necrolysis;visual hallucination,,

In Japan, important regulation changes in the vaccine spontaneous reporting were implemented between 2009 and 2013; however, no studies had yet assessed the impact of the changes. The objective of this study was to assess the impact on the reporting trends in vaccine reports and on signal detection for vaccines. Methods: For assessment of the impact on the reporting trends, we performed the joinpoint trend analysis and descriptively considered number of vaccine reports grouped by the timing of the regulation change. For assessment of the impact on signal detection, we performed signal detection using dataset during the pre or postperiod of the regulation changes, and compared their agreement rates, which was calculated with a reference set for vaccines, created by the Global Research in Paediatrics project. Results: We retrieved 467 635 spontaneous reports, including 12 287 vaccine reports from April 2004 to March 2019. The average number of vaccine reports per year increased from 231 reports during the preperiod to 1227 during the postperiod. The joinpoint trend analysis found two joinpoints and differentiated three trends, significant increased trend of which was observed when regulations had changed. For signal detection, the agreement rate was improved when using data during the postperiod. Conclusion: We concluded that the regulation changes increased the number of vaccine reports, and could have improved signal detection performance for vaccines by accelerating accumulation of reports, while more spontaneous reports are necessary to optimize signal detection.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Usa dados de Vacinas | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Vacinas",10.1002/pds.5231,adult;adverse event;aged;anaphylaxis;article;controlled study;convulsion;data mining;female;Guillain Barre syndrome;health care personnel;human;hypotonic hyporesponsive episode;Japan;major clinical study;male;Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities;paralytic poliomyelitis;pharmacoepidemiology;pharmacovigilance;signal detection;thrombocytopenia;vaccine;wheezing,,

We aimed to examine carbamazepine- and oxcarbazepine-associated Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis, by data mining the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Methods: Reports in FAERs were analysed, from the first quarter of 2004 to the last quarter of 2019. Pharmacovigilance tools were employed for the quantitative detection of signals, where a signal represents a drug-associated adverse event, including the reporting odds ratio, proportional reporting ratio, an information component given by a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and the empirical Bayes geometric mean. Results: The total number of reports identified as Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis associated with carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine included in this study was 1231. FAERS reports associated with carbamazepine were 1048, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (n = 668) and toxic epidermal necrolysis(n = 380). FAERS reports associated with oxcarbazepine were 183, including 142 Stevens-Johnson syndrome and 41 toxic epidermal necrolysis reports. The risk for Stevens-Johnson syndrome is higher than for toxic epidermal necrolysis and carbamazepine is associated with a higher risk than oxcarbazepine.

In response to this, new methods are being developed that attempt to research and monitor the digital environment. In this commentary we present three case studies of innovative approaches and related challenges to software-automated data mining of the digital environment: (i) an e-shop finder to detect e-shops offering new psychoactive substances, (ii) scraping of forum data from online discussion boards, (iii) automated sentiment analysis of discussions in online discussion boards. We conclude that the work presented brings opportunities in terms of leveraging data for developing a more timely and granular understanding of the various aspects of drug-use phenomena in the digital environment. In particular, combining the number of e-shops, discussion posts, and sentiments regarding particular substances could be used for ad hoc risk assessments as well as longitudinal drug monitoring and indicate “online popularity”.

Too few drugs included in the criteria cannot guarantee the safety of medication for the elderly. Too many drugs included in the criteria will result in less selective medication for the elderly. This paper uses real-world data to evaluate the relationship between antihypertensive drugs and falls, so as to provide references for experts and scholars to revise the criteria of potentially inappropriate medications for the elderly and clinical safe medication. Method: We use the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FDA FAERS) to evaluate the association between specific antihypertensive drugs in six categories (alpha-1 receptor blockers (α-1 blockers), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-receptor blockers (β-blockers), and diuretics) and falls by data mining algorithms, including the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), and the empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM) and compared with the relevant drugs included in the Beers Criteria and STOPP/START Criteria. Result: There are a total of 5,157,172 co-occurrences found in 973,447 reports aged 65 years or older from 2016 to 2019 in the FDA FAERS database, and the number of co-occurrences of falls is 5917 for the six categories of 51 antihypertensive drugs. Four kinds of mining methods overlap detection of 12 kinds of positive signal drugs, none of which are not included in the Beers Criteria and 7 drugs are included in the STOPP/START Criteria; 1–3 kinds of mining methods overlap detection of positive signal drugs, a total of 12 kinds, and one drug is included in the Beers Criteria and 5 drugs are included in the STOPP/START Criteria; 22 drugs have fall adverse events, but no positive signal is detected, and 13 drugs are included in STOPP/START Criteria; and 5 drugs have no fall adverse events and 3 drugs are included in the STOPP/START Criteria. Conclusion: The FAERS database was used to confirm the potential connection between some antihypertensive drugs and fall adverse events through data mining algorithms. The Beers Criteria did not clearly indicate the antihypertensive drugs that caused falls, and the antihypertensive drugs included in the STOPP/START Criteria were too extensive and did not include β-blockers and diuretics. It is recommended that experts and scholars use real-world data (such as FAERS, EudraVigilance, WHO VigiBase, and so on) to further explore the relationship between specific antihypertensive drugs and falls in the elderly, so as to revise and improve the criteria for inappropriate medications for the elderly.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza DM,Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.1007/s00228-021-03175-0,acebutolol;aged;aging;algorithm;alpha 1 adrenergic receptor blocking agent;amlodipine;angiotensin 2 receptor antagonist;antihypertensive therapy;article;atenolol;benazepril;beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent;betaxolol;bisoprolol;blurred vision;bradycardia;calcium channel blocking agent;candesartan;candesartan hexetil;captopril;chlorothiazide;clevidipine;data base;data mining;diltiazem;dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor;diuretic agent;dizziness;doxazosin;drug safety;enalapril;esmolol;fall risk assessment;falling;fatigue;felodipine;Food and Drug Administration;fosinopril;furosemide;human;hydrochlorothiazide;indapamide;irbesartan;isradipine;lisinopril;metoprolol;nebivolol;nicardipine;nifedipine;nisoldipine;orthostatic hypotension;patient;perindopril;personalized medicine;pharmacist;pharmacovigilance;polypharmacy;potentially inappropriate medication;prazosin;propranolol;quinapril;ramipril;research;side effect;signal detection;spironolactone;telmisartan;terazosin;timolol;trandolapril;valsartan;verapamil,,

Pharmacovigilance is the process of collection, detection, assessment, monitoring and prevention of adverse drug events in both clinical trials as well as in the post-marketing phase. The recent trends in increasing unknown adverse events, known as signals, have raised the need to develop an ideal system for monitoring and detecting the potential signals timely. The process of signal management comprises of techniques to identify individual case safety reports systematically. Automated signal detection is highly based upon the data mining of the spontaneous reporting system such as reports from health care professional, observational studies, medical literature or from social media. If a signal is not managed properly, it can become an identical risk associated with the drug which can be hazardous for the patient safety and may have fatal outcomes which may impact health care system adversely. Once a signal is detected quantitatively, it can be further processed by the signal management team for the qualitative analysis and further evaluations. The main components of automated signal detection are data extraction, data acquisition, data selection, and data analysis and data evaluation. This system must be developed in the correct format and context, which eventually emphasizes the quality of data collected and leads to the optimal decision-making based upon the scientific evaluation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Artigo Teórico | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Revisão",10.1093/bib/bbaa363,data mining;drug surveillance program;factual database;human;information processing,,

APAP has been used to close a persistently patent ductus arteriosus. Fetal constriction/closure of the ductus arteriosus (FCCDA), of public health interest given the drug’s widespread use during pregnancy, is being monitored globally, including by the European Medicines Agency Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee. Our objective was to share a comprehensive signal evaluation of FCCDA with in utero APAP exposure to determine if the totality of evidence is sufficiently more consistent with one of the following two possibilities: (1) APAP never contributes to FCCDA (null hypothesis or HO) versus (2) APAP may in some cases be at least a contributory cause of in utero DA narrowing (alternative hypothesis or HA) to justify risk communication. Methods: To assess the relative support for HO versus HA, we synthesize and interpret within an Austin Bradford Hill criteria framework a comprehensive, cross-disciplinary set of published information and de novo analysis, including toxicology, epidemiology, clinical pharmacology, and clinical and quantitative pharmacovigilance analysis of spontaneous reports. Results: While residual uncertainty remains, the totality of information is more compatible with HA than H0, to the extent that it is reasonably possible that APAP may sometimes be at least a contributory cause of FCCDA. Conclusion: It is reasonably possible that APAP may sometimes be at least a contributory cause of FCCDA, and this should therefore be communicated to stakeholders.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza DM,Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Revisão",10.1007/s00228-020-03039-z,adverse event;analgesic agent;animal experiment;animal model;antirheumatic agent;article;austin bradford hill criteria;benoxaprofen;cardiovascular effect;clinical assessment;clinical classification;clinical decision making;clinical evaluation;clinical pharmacology;conceptual framework;controlled study;data mining;diclofenac;drug exposure;drug specificity;ductus arteriosus;epidemiological data;evidence based practice;female;fetal ductus arteriosus constriction closure;fetus;fetus heart;freedom of information act;human;ibuprofen;indometacin;naproxen;nonhuman;outcome assessment;paracetamol;patent ductus arteriosus;pericardial effusion;pharmacokinetic parameters;pharmacokinetics;pharmacovigilance;phenylbutazone;piroxicam;prematurity;prenatal exposure;rat;risk assessment;salicylic acid derivative;second trimester pregnancy;sulindac;systematic review;third trimester pregnancy;toxicology;ventricular hypertrophy,,

Trial results are reviewed by experts and consensus panels for producing meta-analyses and clinical practice guidelines. However, reviewing these results is a long and tedious task, hence the meta-analyses and guidelines are not updated each time a new trial is published. Moreover, the independence of experts may be difficult to appraise. On the contrary, in many other domains, including medical risk analysis, the advent of data science, big data and visual analytics allowed moving from expert-based to fact-based knowledge. Since 12 years, many trial results are publicly available online in trial registries. Nevertheless, data science methods have not yet been applied widely to trial data. In this paper, we present a platform for analyzing the safety events reported during clinical trials and published in trial registries. This platform is based on an ontological model including 582 trials on pain treatments, and uses semantic web technologies for querying this dataset at various levels of granularity. It also relies on a 26-dimensional flower glyph for the visualization of the Adverse Drug Events (ADE) rates in 13 categories and 2 levels of seriousness. We illustrate the interest of this platform through several use cases and we were able to find back conclusions that were initially found during meta-analyses. The platform was presented to four experts in drug safety, and is publicly available online, with the ontology of pain treatment ADE.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 9; CODEN: AIMEE</p>

This review of the FDA's quarterly web-posted results is the first to document the contributions of the program to maintaining the continued safe use of approved pharmaceutical drugs/biologics and the lessons that have emerged from this rich experience. Methods: Details on proprietary prescription drugs/biologics, generic prescription drugs, and over-the-counter drugs were downloaded from the quarterly posts that begin in first quarter of 2008. Key information was tabulated, including proprietary and generic names of products or classes of products, the identified potential signals of serious risks, the labeling-decision category (updated, no action is necessary at this time, or evaluating the need for regulatory action), the labeling section (Warnings and Precautions, Adverse Reactions, Drug Safety Communications, Contraindications, or Boxed Warnings), and estimated times to updated decisions. Findings: Since the beginning of the FDAAA Section 921 posting requirement, the FDA has posted 555 potential signals of serious risk or new safety information. Of these, there have been 262 posts (47%) that resulted in decisions requiring updated product labeling, 75 posts (14%) that resulted in decisions that no action was necessary, and 218 posts (39%) indicating that the FDA was evaluating the need for regulatory action. Of the 262 posts that required updating one or more sections of a product label, there was a preponderance of Warnings and Precautions, with 172 (66%); followed by Adverse Reactions, with 114 (44%); Drug Safety Communications, 44 (18%); Contraindications, 27 (10%); and Boxed Warnings, 19 (7%). The median times to update decisions were 12 months for Warnings & Precautions, Adverse Reactions, and Boxed Warnings, and 11 months for Contraindications. Implications: Important themes from the present analysis include the following: (1) nearly 80% of posts resulted in updated product labeling; (2) 20% of decisions concerned classes of proprietary and generic drug/biologic products; (3) product-use errors, such as name confusion, continue to be important; (4) the safe use of pharmaceuticals in children is gaining attention but still has a long way to go; and (5) drug–drug interactions are of continuing concern. The FDA Amendments Act § 921 program will continue to have an important place in the future of pharmacovigilance practices.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - REVISÃO | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Revisão",10.1016/j.clinthera.2020.12.011,article;biological product;child health care;data mining;drug approval;drug contraindication;drug information;drug packaging;drug safety;Food and Drug Administration;generic drug;human;non prescription drug;pharmacovigilance;prescription drug;statistics,,

Here, we present a thorough descriptive analysis of reports to a national passive vaccine safety surveillance system (VAERS) of myopericarditis after vaccines licensed for use in the United States. Methods: We identified U.S. reports of myopericarditis received by VAERS during 1990–2018 that met a published case definition for myopericarditis or were physician-diagnosed. We stratified analysis by age group (<19, 19–49, ≥50 years), describing reports by serious/non-serious status, sex, time to symptom onset after vaccination, vaccine(s) administered, and exposure to other known causes of myopericarditis. We used Empirical Bayesian data mining to detect disproportionate reporting of myopericarditis after vaccination. Results: VAERS received 620,195 reports during 1990–2018: 708 (0.1%) met the case definition or were physician-diagnosed as myopericarditis. Most (79%) myopericarditis reports described males; 69% were serious; 72% had symptom onset ≤ 2 weeks postvaccination. Overall, smallpox (59%) and anthrax (23%) vaccines were most commonly reported. By age, among persons aged < 19 years, Haemophilus influenzae type b (22, 22%) and hepatitis B (18, 18%); among persons aged 19–49 years smallpox (387, 79%); among persons aged ≥ 50 years inactivated influenza (31, 36%) and live attenuated zoster (19, 22%) vaccines were most commonly reported. The vaccines most commonly reported remained unchanged when excluding 138 reports describing other known causes of myopericarditis. Data mining revealed disproportionate reporting of myopericarditis only after smallpox vaccine. Conclusions: Despite the introduction of new vaccines over the years, myopericarditis remains rarely reported after vaccines licensed for use in the United States. In this analysis, myopericarditis was most commonly reported after smallpox vaccine, and less commonly after other vaccines.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Usa dados de Vacinas | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Vacinas",10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.12.046,adolescent;adult;anthrax;anthrax vaccine;article;child;data mining;female;groups by age;Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine;health care system;hepatitis B;hepatitis B vaccine;herpes zoster;human;infant;influenza B;major clinical study;male;myocarditis;newborn;pericarditis;pharmacovigilance;priority journal;sex;smallpox;smallpox vaccine;United States;vaccination;varicella zoster vaccine,,

From a clinical point of view, it is characterized by acute flare-ups of intense itching, eczematous pruritic lesions involving dry skin. Dupilumab is the only biologic agent approved to treat moderate to severe course of atopic dermatitis, which can be particularly severe during pregnancy causing distress and impacting on maternal and fetal health. However, there is a dearth of data concerning the safety profile of Dupilumab during gestation. Therefore, we took advantage of a large global pharmacovigilance database. From inception up to March 9, 2021, 94,065 adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from 37,848 unique reports were retrieved. Of these, 36 reports related to pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal ADR could be extracted from the pharmacovigilance database. More than half of reports (n = 21; 58.3%) were spontaneous abortion, followed by other events, including exposure to the drug during the pregnancy (n = 8; 22.2%). Two cases of abortion were reported. No studied pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal ADR was found to be associated with the use of Dupilumab. The only OR significantly greater than 1 was the OR associated with the risk of developing heterotopic pregnancy (21.66 [95% CrI 2.95-159.02]) even if the IC was highly imprecise (1.45 [95% CrI from -2.34 to 3.09]), probably because of the single case of heterotopic pregnancy reported. In conclusion, Dupilumab use appears safe during gestation. Further studies are needed, especially to better understand the mechanisms underlying the pharmacological actions and ADR of Dupilumab.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.26355/eurrev_202109_26652,article;atopic dermatitis;data mining;distress syndrome;drug monitoring;drug safety;dupilumab;ectopic pregnancy;eczema;human;inflammation;major clinical study;nerve cell network;pharmacovigilance;preeclampsia;pregnancy;pruritus;puerperium;signal detection,,

Whilst biologic therapy is traditionally regarded as immunosuppressive and capable to increase the infectious risk, Dupilumab does not display these characteristics and may be even protective in certain cases. We investigated the link between Dupilumab therapy and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Materials and Methods: We carried out a comprehensive data mining and disproportionality analysis of the WHO global pharmacovigilance database. One asymptomatic COVID-19 case, 106 cases of symptomatic COVID-19, and 2 cases of severe COVID-19 pneumonia were found. Results: Dupilumab treated patients were at higher risk of COVID-19 (with an IC0.25of 3.05), even though infections were less severe (IC0.25of -1.71). The risk of developing COVID-19 was significant both among males and females (with an IC0.25of 0.24 and 0.58, respectively). The risk of developing COVID-19 was significant in the agegroup of 45-64 years (with an IC0.25of 0.17). Conclusions: Dupilumab use seems to reduce COVID-19 related severity. Further studies are needed to better understand the immunological mechanisms and clinical implications of these findings. Remarkably, the heterogenous nature of the reports and the database structure did not allow to establish a cause-effect link, but only an epidemiologically decreased risk in the patients subset treated with dupilumab.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Tópico desalinhado",10.26355/eurrev_202109_26808,adult;age;aged;allergy;article;Asia;asymptomatic infection;back propagation neural network;big data;coronavirus disease 2019;data analysis;data mining;disease severity;drug safety;drug use;dupilumab;dupixent;Europe;female;human;infection risk;major clinical study;male;middle aged;Pacific islands;pharmacovigilance;risk reduction;virus pneumonia;Western Hemisphere;World Health Organization;young adult,,

Methods: We compared three commonly used liver chemistry criteria from the DILI expert working group (DEWG), DILI network (DILIN), and Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS), based on hospital EMR for years 2010 and 2011 (42 176 admissions), using independent medical record review. The performance characteristics were compared in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value, accuracy, F-measure, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Results: DEWG had the highest PPV (5.5%, 95% CI: 4.1%-7.2%), specificity (97.0%, 95% CI: 96.8%-97.2%), accuracy (96.8%, 95% CI: 96.6%-97.0%) and F-measure (0.099). CIOMS had the highest sensitivity (74.0%, 95% CI: 64.3%-82.3%) and AUROC (85.2%, 95% CI: 80.8%-89.7%). Besides the laboratory criteria, including additional keywords in the classification algorithm improved the PPV and F-measure to a maximum of 29.0% (95% CI: 22.3%-36.5%) and 0.379, respectively. Conclusions: More stringent criteria (DEWG and DILIN) performed better in terms of PPV, specificity, accuracy and F-measure. CIOMS performed better in terms of sensitivity. An algorithm with high sensitivity is useful in pharmacovigilance for detecting rare events and to avoid missing cases. Requiring at least two abnormal liver chemistries during hospitalization and text-word searching in the discharge summaries decreased false positives without loss in sensitivity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Dados de bases não oficiais",10.1002/pds.5099,accuracy;adult;aged;alanine aminotransferase;alanine aminotransferase blood level;alkaline phosphatase;alkaline phosphatase blood level;allopurinol;amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid;article;aspartate aminotransferase;aspartate aminotransferase blood level;atorvastatin;carbamazepine;case report;ceftriaxone;clarithromycin;classification algorithm;clinical article;clofarabine;colchicine;cotrimoxazole;cyclophosphamide;cytarabine;data mining;detection algorithm;doxycycline;electronic medical record;enalapril;ethambutol;etoposide;ezetimibe;female;fluconazole;fluoxetine;human;hydrochlorothiazide;hydroxyurea;hypertransaminasemia;imatinib;intermethod comparison;isoniazid;itraconazole;lisinopril;lorazepam;male;medical record review;metformin;methotrexate;mevinolin;mirtazapine;nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent;pharmacovigilance;phenytoin;piperacillin plus tazobactam;posaconazole;predictive value;priority journal;pyrazinamide;quetiapine;rosuvastatin;sensitivity and specificity;simvastatin;toxic hepatitis;valproic acid;voriconazole,,

Identification and investigation of drug safety signals – concerning notably rare and unknown adverse drug reactions – is one of the major tasks in pharmacovigilance that can be amplified by automated signal detection. Several quantitative statistical methods exist, each with its own strengths and limits. Integrating signal detection, pharmacovigilance databases can be used for a wide variety of retrospective observational studies illustrated here by concrete examples. Confirming these signals by orthogonal validation using pre-clinical platforms and prospective trials is helpful. Pharmacovigilance databases represent a considerable source of information.

Research Design and method: Reports of psoriasis associated with use of Angiotensin receptor blocker class of drug were retrieved from public version of Canadian Adverse Reaction (CADRMP) database between January 2000 and December 2016 and analyzed for quantitative signal detection by data mining algorithms mainly reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratios (PRR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of PRR. Also for qualitative analysis, reports for psoriasis associated with ARBs were obtained from literature regulatory agency reports for period from 2000 to 2016. Results: Based on CADRMP data from January 2000 and December 2016, total 9 reports were obtained for psoriasis associated with use of ARBs. Thus, as per our results obtained; value of PRR, ROR and 95% CI for PRR were found to be 17.5, 17.7 and 4.4, respectively indicating significant new signal for aggravated psoriasis associated with ARBs use, however these signals were stronger for Valsartan than other ARBs. Conclusions: Thus public version of CADRMP database as well as literatures and regulatory agency report represents an important source to detect signals of psoriasis. In particular, our present study generated significant new signals for psoriasis among ARBs for which further investigations and active surveillance are warranted.

Paliperidone is a new atypical antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia. Several case reports about unexpected adverse drug reactions of paliperidone have been consistently reported around the world. The purpose of this study was to detect signals of adverse events (AEs) after paliperidone treatment using the Korea Institute of Drug Safety and Risk Management–Korea Adverse Event Reporting System database (KIDS-KD). Methods: We applied data-mining techniques based on a disproportionality analysis to KIDS-KD consisting of spontaneously reported AE reports related to atypical antipsychotics between January 2009 and December 2018. We calculated three data-mining indices of paliperidone compared to all other atypical antipsychotics. We defined signals that satisfied all three criteria of the indices. We checked if the signals identified were included in the drug labels for South Korea, the USA, the UK, Japan, Germany, and France. Results: The total number of suspected AE reports related to all atypical antipsychotics in the KIDS-KD from January 2009 to December 2018 was 43,970. Among those, the number of AE reports related to paliperidone was 9453. Overall, 13 signals such as seborrhea, hallucination, obesity, gingivitis, and intervertebral disorder were classified into newly detected meaningful signals. Conclusion: We detected new AE signals of paliperidone that were not listed on the drug labels of six countries, and many that were related to psychotic symptoms, metabolic problems, and endocrine disorders.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.1007/s40261-020-00945-z,adverse drug reaction;aggression;amenorrhea;amisulpride;anorgasmia;aripiprazole;arthropathy;article;atypical antipsychotic agent;body weight loss;bradykinesia;breast tumor;catatonia;clozapine;data base;data mining;delusion;drug safety;dystonia;extrapyramidal syndrome;France;gastroesophageal reflux;Germany;gingivitis;hallucination;human;hyperkinesia;hyperlipidemia;hyperprolactinemia;hypertriglyceridemia;insomnia;intervertebral disk disease;Japan;lactation;liver cell damage;menstruation disorder;migraine;muscle hypertonia;obesity;olanzapine;osteoarthritis;paliperidone;paradoxical drug reaction;paranoia;personality disorder;priority journal;psychosis;psychosomatic disorder;quetiapine;risk management;risperidone;schizophrenic reaction;seborrhea;side effect;South Korea;suicide attempt;tongue disease;United Kingdom;United States;uterus myoma;vaginitis;ziprasidone;zotepine,,

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used to identify words which relate association among drugs and genes from the sentences which are collected from literatures where words represent drugs and genes cooccurred. The relation between drugs and genes is represented through building drug-topic probability matrix by topic modeling. From the drug-topic probability matrix, the drugs for phenotypes can be identified by training a classifier for high-rank topics of drugs. It also predicted the association between drug and side effects. However, expressive power of named entities and their potential for enhancing the quality of discovered topics has not received much attention in PISTON. So in this paper, an Improved PISTON (IPISTON) is proposed which enhance the quality of discovered topics through named entity recognition system and inducing the syntactic structure from unannotated sentences. Initially, the sentences from the collected literature data are extracted and a dependency graph is constructed using NLP. After that, a Gene Regulation Score (GRS) of each sentence is calculated to define the relationship between gene and diseases. The topic modeling is enhanced by finding the biomedical entities in the biomedical repository using Conditional Random Field (CRF) and Bi-directional Long-Short Term Memory-CRF (BLSTM-CRF). CRF is a sequence modeling framework which finds the biomedical entities through the conditional probability distributions of biomedical entities on collected documents. BLSTM-CRF is a deep learning technique which is used to enhance the performance of CRF based named entity recognition. Moreover, the syntactic structure of sentences is calculated through syntactic distance measure. The syntactic structure, biomedical entities and the drug-topic probability matrix is given as input to CRF, BLSTM-CRF, Naïve Bayes, CART and Logistic for prediction of drug-phenotype and drug-side effects associations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Dados de bases não oficiais",,ageusia;amnesia;anxiety disorder;article;ataxia;Bayesian learning;bi directional long short term memory;bladder cancer;bradycardia;breast cancer;cataract;cerebrovascular disease;cheilitis;classification and regression tree;classifier;colitis;conditional random field;cystitis;data mining;deep learning;delirium;depression;diplopia;eczema;fatigue;gastritis;gene control;gout;heart disease;heartburn;human;hyperglycemia;hyperlipidemia;hypotension;hypothermia;inflammation;laryngitis;lung edema;machine learning;melanoma;myeloid leukemia;natural language processing;non small cell lung cancer;ovary cancer;phenotype;predict drug indications and side effects using topic modeling and natural language processing;probability;prostate cancer;proteinuria;short term memory;sleep disorder;small cell lung cancer;tachycardia;task performance;ulcer,,

The analysis of data is very useful for raising early warnings on possible adverse reactions of drugs. Association rule mining techniques have been heavily explored by the research community for identifying binary association between drugs and their adverse effects. But these techniques perform poorly and miss out several interesting associations when it comes to analysis of multidimensional data which may include multiple patient attributes, drugs and adverse drug reactions. In the present work, a clustering-based hybrid approach has been presented for finding quantitative multidimensional association from the large amount of data. Firstly, it employs clustering technique for segmentation of data into semantically coherent clusters. Furthermore, disproportionality method called proportional reporting ratio is applied on clustered data for generating statistically strong associations. The performance of the proposed methodology has been examined on the data taken from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database corresponding to Aspirin and nine other drugs which are prescribed along with Aspirin. The experimental results show that the proposed approach discovered a number of association rules which are very comprehensive and informative regarding relationship of patient traits and drugs with adverse drug reactions. On comparing experimental results with LPMiner, it is observed that the quantitative association rules discovered by LPMiner are just 8.3% of what have been discovered by the proposed methodology.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Base governamental,Desenvolvimento do método",10.1007/s12539-020-00365-9,acetylsalicylic acid;adverse drug reaction;algorithm;cluster analysis;data mining;human,,

To fill some gaps in the understanding and elucidate potential biological mechanisms of action frequently associated with MCAEs, we present a unique workflow linking observational population data with the available knowledge at molecular, cellular, and psychopharmacology levels. It is based on statistical analysis of pharmacovigilance reports and subsequent signaling pathway analyses, followed by evidence-based expert manual curation of the outcomes. Our analysis: (a) ranked pharmaceuticals with high occurrence of such adverse events (AEs), based on disproportionality analysis of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, and (b) identified 120 associated genes and common pathway nodes possibly underlying MCAEs. Nearly two-thirds of the identified genes were related to immune modulation, which supports the critical involvement of immune cells and their responses in the regulation of the central nervous system function. This finding also means that pharmaceuticals with a negligible central nervous system exposure may induce MCAEs through dysregulation of the peripheral immune system. Knowledge gained through this workflow unravels putative hallmark biological targets and mediators of drug-induced mood and cognitive disorders that need to be further assessed and validated in experimental models.

There is a body of research on signal detection for drug interactions in collections of individual case reports, but limited use in regular pharmacovigilance. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of signal detection of drug–drug interactions in collections of individual case reports of suspected adverse drug reactions. Methods: This study was conducted in VigiBase, the WHO global database of individual case safety reports. The data lock point was 31 August 2016, which provided 13.6 million reports for analysis after deduplication. Statistical signal detection was performed using a previously developed predictive model for possible drug interactions. The model accounts for an interaction disproportionality measure, expressed suspicion of an interaction by the reporter, potential for interaction through cytochrome P450 activity of drugs, and reported information indicative of unexpected therapeutic response or altered therapeutic effect. Triage filters focused the preliminary signal assessment on combinations relating to serious adverse events with case series of no more than 30 reports from at least two countries, with at least one report during the previous 2 years. Additional filters sought to eliminate already known drug interactions through text mining of standard literature sources. Preliminary signal assessment was performed by a multidisciplinary group of pharmacovigilance professionals from Uppsala Monitoring Centre and collaborating organizations, whereas in-depth signal assessment was performed by experienced pharmacovigilance assessors. Results: We performed preliminary signal assessment for 407 unique drug pairs. Of these, 157 drug pairs were considered already known to interact, whereas 232 were closed after preliminary assessment for other reasons. Ten drug pairs were subjected to in-depth signal assessment and an additional eight were decided to be kept under review awaiting additional reports. The triage filters had a major impact in focusing our preliminary signal assessment on just 14% of the statistical signals generated by the predictive model for drug interactions. In-depth assessment led to three signals communicated with the broader pharmacovigilance community, six closed signals and one to be kept under review. Conclusion: This study shows that signals of adverse drug interactions can be detected through broad statistical screening of individual case reports. It further shows that signal assessment related to possible drug interactions requires more detailed information on the temporal relationship between different drugs and the adverse event. Future research may consider whether interaction signal detection should be performed not for individual adverse event terms but for pairs of drugs across a spectrum of adverse events.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 18; Correspondence Address: S.

Here, we identified and characterized significant colitis-associated with ICIs. Methods: Based on the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from January 2004 to December 2019, the disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis, including the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) and the multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS) algorithms were adopted to data mining of the suspected adverse events of colitis after ICIs administrating. Clinical characteristics of patients with ICIs-associated colitis and the time to onset of colitis following different ICI regimens were collected. Results: A total of 3786 reports of colitis adverse events were identified with ICIs. Seven ICI monotherapies were associated with the reporting of colitis. Statistically significant ROR, PRR, information component (IC), and empirical Bayesian geometric mean (EBGM) emerged for all ICI monotherapies and combination therapies. ICIs-associated colitis affected mostly male (53.51%), with a wide mean age range (60.65 to 72 years). Colitis adverse events were commonly reported in patients with melanoma and lung cancer. Adverse outcomes of colitis concerning ICI were mainly outcomes of hospitalization-initiated or prolonged and other serious. Among colitis cases, 17.43% cases of colitis concerning ICI lead to death. The adverse event of colitis occurred earliest in ipilimumab monotherapy with a median time to onset of 64.21 days (IQR: 27–69 days) among all monotherapies. Conclusions: ICI may lead to severe and disabling ICIs-associated colitis during therapy. Analysis of FAERS data identified signals for adverse events of colitis with ICI regimens. Practitioners should consider the factors that may increase the likelihood of colitis. The findings support a continued surveillance and risk factor identification studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106601,acute kidney failure;adrenal insufficiency;adult;adverse outcome;aged;arthritis;article;atezolizumab;avelumab;Bayes theorem;cemiplimab;colitis;conjunctivitis;data base;data mining;drug use;durvalumab;encephalitis;female;Food and Drug Administration;hepatitis;hospitalization;human;hyperthyroidism;hypophysitis;hypothyroidism;immune checkpoint inhibitor;immunological antineoplastic agent;ipilimumab;liver toxicity;lung cancer;major clinical study;male;melanoma;middle aged;monotherapy;myasthenia gravis;nephritis;neutropenia;nivolumab;oral mucositis;outcome assessment;pancreatitis;pembrolizumab;pharmacovigilance;pneumonia;priority journal;pure red cell anemia;rash;retrospective study;signal detection;Sjoegren syndrome;thrombocytopenia;unclassified drug;uveitis,,

In this study, we compared the use of four quantitative data mining (QDM) methods with weekly manual review to determine if signals of disproportionate reporting (SDRs) can improve the efficiency of manual reviews and thereby enhance drug safety signal detection. Methods: We formulated a QDM triage strategy to reduce the number of SDRs for weekly review and compared the results against those derived from manual reviews alone for the same 6-month period. We then incorporated QDM triage into the manual review workflow for the subsequent two 6-month periods and made further comparisons against QDM triage alone. Results: The incorporation of QDM triage into routine manual reviews resulted in a reduction of 20% to 30% in the number of drug–AE pairs identified for further evaluation. Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) detected more signals that mirror human manual signal detection than the other three methods.

Methods: Electronic patient records of a psychiatric population (1427 men and 727 women) were text mined for potential ADEs. The relative risk of experiencing specific ADEs and co-occurrence of ADEs were calculated for each sex. Results: Findings included 55 potential ADEs with significantly different frequencies between the two sexes. Of these, 20 were more frequent in men, with relative risks of 1.10–7.64, and 35 were more frequent in women, with relative risks of 1.19–21.58. Frequent potential ADEs were psychiatric symptoms, including sexual dysfunction and disturbances in men, and gastrointestinal symptoms, suicidal and self-injurious behaviour and hyperprolactinemia-related events in women. Mention of different hyperprolactinemia-related ADEs often co-occurred in female patients but not in male patients.

Mining signals using the spontaneous reporting systems is a very effective method for single drug-induced AE monitoring as well as early detection of DDIs. The objective of this study was to compare signal detection algorithms for DDIs based on frequency statistical models. Methods: Five frequency statistical models: the Ω shrinkage measure, additive (risk difference), multiplicative (risk ratio), combination risk ratio, and chi-square statistics models were compared using the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database as the spontaneous reporting system in Japan. The drugs targeted for the survey are all registered and classified as “suspect drugs” in JADER, and the AEs targeted for this study were the same as those in a previous study on Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS). Results: Of 3924 pairs that reported SJS, the number of signals detected by the Ω shrinkage measure, additive, multiplicative, combination risk ratio, and chi-square statistics models was 712, 3298, 2252, 739, and 1289 pairs, respectively. Among the five models, the Ω shrinkage measure model showed the most conservative signal detection tendency. Conclusion: Specifically, caution should be exercised when the number of reports is low because results differ depending on the statistical models. This study will contribute to the selection of appropriate statistical models to detect signals of potential DDIs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Desenvolvimento do método,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.1007/s11095-020-02801-3,additive model;adverse drug reaction;allopurinol;article;auranofin;azulene derivative;chi square statistics model;cimetidine;colestilan;combination risk ratio model;comparative study;confidence interval;contingency table;data mining;detection algorithm;diclofenac;drug interaction;epinastine;frequency analysis;glutamine;kappa statistics;levothyroxine sodium;mecobalamin;multiplicative model;pentoxyverine;pranoprofen;priority journal;shrinkage measure model;signal detection;sodium azulene sulfonate hydrate;spontaneous reporting system;statistical model;unclassified drug,,

Recently, there are growing concerns related to the potential cardiotoxicity of herbal medicines but comprehensive studies are limited. Methods: Comprehensive literature retrieval via publicly available electronic databases was performed to identify the case reports that focused on cardiac adverse reactions (ADRs) triggered by oral CMMs. And a bibliometric survey was conducted to analyze the most commonly suspected risk factors in terms of responsible CMMs, susceptible patients and clinical administration of cardiac ADRs. Moreover, the techniques of data mining were utilized to investigate the regularities and association between the ADRs status and major contributory factors. Results: The available evidence of current research indicated that many influential factors were strongly associated with cardiac ADRs caused by oral CMMs inevitably, including pediatric patients, poisonous CMMs (especially herbs of Aconitum species), overdose and self-medication. Specifically, the timely and effective resuscitation could attribute their favorable capacity to reduce mortality for cardiac ADRs. Notably, the cardiac ADRs cases had often concomitant the ADRs of the nervous system and digestive system. Conclusion: The comprehensive features and risk factors of cardiac ADRs induced by oral CMMs can be discovered and elucidated through the approaches of bibliometric research, association rules analysis, and data mining technology, which raise the profile and awareness of the rational applications of CMMs and pharmacovigilance within relevant heart side effects.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 12; Correspondence Address: B.

Conclusions: Seven new signals that were not included in the current label were identified for TNFα inhibitors and should be updated and monitored.Key Points• Large-scale spontaneous AE reporting data and data mining techniques are useful for detecting signals of rare AEs as well as common AEs induced by drugs.• Drug labels should be updated to reflect signals that are newly discovered by continuous monitoring.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.1007/s10067-019-04802-z,acne;adalimumab;adult;adverse drug reaction;alopecia;article;body temperature sensation;comparative study;data base;data mining;drug hypersensitivity;drug use;dyspnea;etanercept;face edema;female;generalized edema;heart palpitation;herpes zoster;human;hyperkeratosis;hypertransaminasemia;hypotension;infliximab;injection site bleeding;injection site pain;injection site pruritus;injection site rash;Korea;liver dysfunction;major clinical study;male;methotrexate;pharmacovigilance;priority journal;pruritus;rash;rigor;sarcoidosis;signal detection;thorax pain;thyroid cancer;United States;urticaria;uveitis,,

Such information should be customizable to individual information needs. While approaches to automatically aggregate ADRs by text-mining processes and establishment of respective databases are well known, further efforts to map additional ADR information are sparse, yet crucial for customization. In a proof-of-principle (PoP) study, we developed a database format demonstrating that natural language processing can further structure ADR information in a way that facilitates customization. Methods: We developed the database in a 3-step process: (1) initial ADR extraction, (2) mapping of additional ADR information, and (3) review process. ADRs of 10 frequently prescribed active ingredients were initially extracted from their Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) by text-mining processes and mapped to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms. To further structure ADR information, we mapped 7 additional ADR characteristics (i.e. frequency, organ class, seriousness, lay perceptibility, onset, duration, and management strategies) to individual ADRs. In a PoP study, the process steps were assessed and tested. Initial ADR extraction was assessed by measuring precision, recall, and F1-scores (i.e. harmonic mean of precision and recall). Mapping of additional ADR information was assessed considering pre-defined parameters (i.e. correctness, errors, and misses) regarding the mapped ADR characteristics. Results: Overall the SmPCs listed 393 ADRs with an average of 39.3 ± 18.1 ADRs per SmPC. For initial ADR extraction precision was 97.9% and recall was 93.2% leading to an F1-score of 95.5%. Regarding mapping of additional ADR information, the frequency information of 28.6 ± 18.4 ADRs for each SmPC was correctly mapped (72.8%). Overall 77 ADRs (20.6%) of the correctly extracted ADRs did not have a concise frequency stated in the SmPC and were consequently mapped with ‘frequency not known’. Mapping of remaining ADR characteristics did not result in noteworthy errors or misses. Conclusion: ADR information can be automatically extracted and mapped to corresponding MedDRA terms. Additionally, ADR information can be further structured considering additional ADR characteristics to facilitate customization to individual patient needs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Dados de bases não oficiais",10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2019.103970,adverse drug reaction;article;data accuracy;data base;data extraction;data mining;data processing;drug information;human;information processing;information retrieval;Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities;natural language processing;priority journal,,

The authors retrospectively investigated adverse events (AEs) by data-mining a self-reporting database to better understand toxicities, especially since it has been used during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: A reporting odds ratio (ROR) was used to detect the risk signals from the data in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adverse event reporting system database (FAERS). The definition relied on system organ class (SOCs) and preferred terms (PTs) by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Results: The search retrieved 1,598 baricitinib-associated cases within the reporting period: 86 PTs with significant disproportionality were retained. Infections including “herpes zoster”, “oral herpes” and “herpes virus infection” were found at a similar rate to those reported in trials, and such events were rare. Reports emerged for several thrombotic adverse events, while these events were also rare. Unexpected safety signals as opportunistic infections were detected. Serious outcomes as death and life-threatening outcomes accounted for 9.76% of the reported cases. Conclusions: The incidence of these AEs does not appear above the background expected.

Detecting DDIs using observational data has at least three major challenges: (1) The number of potential DDIs is astronomical; (2) Associations between drugs and ADRs may not be causal due to observed or unobserved confounding; and (3) Frequently co-prescribed drug pairs that each independently cause an ADR do not necessarily causally interact, where causal interaction means that at least some patients would only experience the ADR if they take both drugs. We address (1) through data mining algorithms pre-filtering potential interactions, and (2) and (3) by fitting causal interaction models adjusting for observed confounders and conducting sensitivity analyses for unobserved confounding. We rank candidate DDIs robust to unobserved confounding more likely to be real.

Specifically, the NeuroADR system exploited a hierarchical multi-task learning (HMTL) framework to perform named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) jointly, where interactions among the learned deep encoder representations from different subtasks are explored. Different from the conventional HMTL approach, NeuroADR adopted a novel task decomposition strategy to generate auxiliary subtasks for more inter-task interactions and integrated a new label encoding schema for better handling discontinuous entities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza DM,Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Dados de bases não oficiais",,adverse drug reaction;data mining;factual database;human;machine learning;procedures,,

This constitutes a major public health concern. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires drug labeling to include potential adverse effects for each newly developed drug product. With the advancement in incidence of adverse drug events (ADEs) and potential adverse drug events, published studies have mainly concluded potential ADEs from labeling documents obtained from the FDA's preapproval clinical trials, and very few analyzed their research work based on reported ADEs after widespread use of a drug to animal subjects. The aforesaid procedure of deriving practice based on information from preapproval labeling may misrepresent or deprecate the incidence and prevalence of specific ADEs. In this study, we make the most of the recently disseminated ADE data by the FDA for animal drugs and devices used in animals to address this public and welfare concern. For this purpose, we implemented 5 different methods (Pearson distance, Spearman distance, cosine distance, Yule distance, and Euclidean distance) to determine the most efficient and robust approach to properly discover highly associated ADEs from the reported data and accurately exclude noise-induced reported events, while maintaining a high level of correlation precision. Our comparative analysis of ADEs based on an artificial intelligence (AI) approach for the 5 robust similarity methods revealed high ADE associations for 2 drugs used in dogs and cats. In addition, the described distance methods systematically analyzed and compared ADEs from the drug labeling sections with a specific emphasis on analyzing serious ADEs. Our finding showed that the cosine method significantly outperformed all the other methods by correctly detecting and validating ADEs based on the comparative similarity association analysis compared with ADEs reported by preapproval clinical trials, premarket testing, or postapproval complication experience of FDA-approved animal drugs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Tópico desalinhado",10.1016/j.tcam.2019.100366,adverse drug reaction;algorithm;article;artificial intelligence;cat;comparative study;controlled study;data accuracy;data mining;dog;Food and Drug Administration;incidence;machine learning;mandatory reporting;mathematical model;noise;nonhuman;pharmacovigilance;prevalence;selamectin;spinosad,,

Methods: Disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis were utilized for data mining of the suspected adverse events of myocarditis after ICIs use based on the Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from January 2004 to June 2018. The times to onset and fatality rates of myocarditis following different ICI regimens were also compared. Results: A total of 315 reports of myocarditis adverse events were identified with ICIs. Among 6 ICI monotherapies, avelumab had the highest association with myocarditis based on the highest reporting odds ratio (ROR = 42.65, 95% two-sided CI = 15.86–114.72), proportional reporting ratio (PRR = 42.61, χ2 = 159.63) and empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM = 41.87, 95% one-sided CI = 15.57). The combination therapies of ipilimumab plus pembrolizumab or nivolumab had higher RORs, PRRs and EBGMs than did pembrolizumab or nivolumab monotherapy. Myocarditis associated with the ipilimumab plus nivolumab treatment appeared to have earlier onset (16.5 [IQR 14–29.75] days vs 32 [IQR 16–77] days, p<0.01) and higher fatality rate (65.75% vs 50.40%, p<0.05) than that associated with nivolumab monotherapy.

There has been continued debate about this topic. Therefore, we present a detailed analysis of data from individual case safety reports of pioglitazone use (PG-ICSRs) associated with bladder cancer reported worldwide and in India. Methods: Data from PG-ICSRs reported by the National Coordination Centre's Pharmacovigilance Programme of India, as well as over 131 World Health Organization member countries in the Uppsala Monitoring Centre's VigiLyze pharmacovigilance database system, from January 1, 1967, to March 4, 2018, were collected. Comparisons between data from global and Indian PG-ICSRs were made by applying filters such as country, bladder cancer, age group, gender, time period, information component, and data mining. Findings: Among the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported with pioglitazone use worldwide, bladder cancer and related terms were the most highly reported (43%). The most frequently co-reported concurrently used drug was metformin, which was included in 25% and 40% of overall and bladder cancer–specific PG-ICSRs, respectively. Suspected bladder cancer–specific pioglitazone-related reactions were reported in 27 countries, with 8548 serious and 1858 fatal cases and an information components value of 9.15. The Americas had the highest relative percentage of suspected bladder cancer in PG-ICSRs (53%), while the prevalence was much lower in India (2%). In both cohorts, men over the age of 45 years constituted the most highly reported population. Implications: India has a very low prevalence of reported overall and bladder cancer–specific pioglitazone-related ADRs compared to Europe and the Americas. Possible explanations for the difference in reporting rates include variance in genetic makeup, low BC risk factor, pioglitazone prescription at a lower therapeutic dose, greater use of chemopreventive spices in the diet, higher frequency of metformin as a concurrent drug, and under-reporting of ADRs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído",10.1016/j.clinthera.2019.08.018,acetylsalicylic acid;adult;adverse drug reaction;Africa;article;Asia;atorvastatin;bladder cancer;bladder metastasis;bladder tumor;body weight gain;cohort analysis;comparative study;congestive heart failure;connective tissue disease;cyclosporine;data mining;diarrhea;dizziness;dyspnea;Europe;eye disease;female;fever;gastrointestinal disease;geographic distribution;glibenclamide;glimepiride;glipizide;heart disease;human;hyperglycemia;Indian;insulin glargine;kidney disease;major clinical study;male;malignant neoplasm;mediastinum disease;metabolic disorder;metformin;middle aged;musculoskeletal disease;nausea;neoplasm;neurologic disease;nutritional disorder;Pacific islands;pharmacovigilance;pioglitazone;prednisolone;prescription;pruritus;rash;respiratory tract disease;retrospective study;side effect;sitagliptin;skin disease;thorax disease;transitional cell carcinoma;ureter cancer;urinary tract disease;vomiting;Western Hemisphere,,

The aim of this study was to obtain novel information on the onset profiles of ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy (IIE) considering other associated clinical factors using the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) databases. Methods: We analyzed the reports of encephalopathy between 2004 and 2018 from the FAERS and JADER databases. To define IIE, we used the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred terms and standardized queries. The reporting odds ratios (ROR) at 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to detect the signal for IIE and adjusted for covariates using a multivariate logistic regression technique. We evaluated the time-to-onset profile of IIE and used the association rule mining technique to discover undetected associations, such as potential risk factors. Results: In the FAERS database, the ROR (CI) for encephalopathy (preferred term, PT) and encephalopathy (standardized MedDRA queries, SMQ) was 56.58 (51.69–61.93) and 1.57 (1.48–1.67), respectively. In the JADER database, the ROR (95% CI) for encephalopathy (PT) and encephalopathy (SMQ) was 13.54 (9.91–18.50) and 1.24 (1.01–1.53), respectively. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed a significant contribution in IIE signal in the ≥ 60 year group (p = 0.00094; vs. < 60 year group) and ≥ 2000 mg/m2 dosage group (p = 0.00045; vs. < 2000 mg/m2 dosage group).

Encephalopathy within the first 7 days of ifosfamide administration was 94.1% for encephalopathy (PT) and 87.7% for encephalopathy (SMQ), respectively. Conclusions: The present analysis demonstrated that the incidence of encephalopathy with ifosfamide should be closely monitored for a short onset (within 7 days).

Objective To analyze signals associated with HPV vaccines using the Korean spontaneous AEs reporting system and data-mining methods and compare the results to current vaccine label information in South Korea and the United States of America, United Kingdom, European Union, and Japan to detect signals not currently listed on the labels. Setting We evaluated the Korea Institute of Drug Safety & Risk Management database from January 2005 to December 2016. After pre-screening the data, the adjusted total numbers of HPV-related AE reports and AEs were 2566 and 4748 and those of all other vaccine-related AE reports and AEs were 21,878 and 120,688, respectively. Methods Three data mining algorithms (proportional reporting ratio, reporting odds ratio and information component) were used to assess AEs. A signal was defined when the criteria for all three indicators were satisfied. The detected signals were compared to the label information of HPV vaccines from South Korea, the United States of America, United Kingdom, European Union, and Japan. Main outcome measure Signals of AE after HPV vaccination, which met all three data mining indices. Results In this study, we found a total 97 signals of AE after HPV vaccination. Of these, 78 AEs were already present on the HPV vaccine labels of South Korea and the following 19 AEs were not listed: neuralgia, tremor, neuritis, depersonalization, axillary pain, personality disorder, increased salivation, peptic ulcer, circulatory failure, hypotension, peripheral ischemia, cerebral hemorrhage, micturition disorder, facial edema, ovarian cyst, weight increase, pain anxiety, oral edema, and back pain. Moreover, AE information on the current HPV vaccine labels of South Korea, the United States of America, United Kingdom, European Union, and Japan was inconsistent.

The World Health Organization underlines the importance of reporting ADRs for patients' safety. The fact is that ADRs tend to be under-reported in daily hospital praxis. In this context, automatic solutions based on text mining can help to alleviate the workload of experts. Nevertheless, these solutions pose two challenges: 1) EHRs show high lexical variability, the characterization of the events must be able to deal with unseen words or contexts and 2) ADRs are rare events, hence, the system should be robust against skewed class distribution. To tackle these challenges, deep neural networks seem appropriate because they allow a high-level representation. Specifically, we opted for a joint AB-LSTM network, a sub-class of the bidirectional long short-term memory network. Besides, in an attempt to reinforce lexical variability, we proposed the use of embeddings created using lemmas. We compared this approach with supervised event extraction approaches based on either symbolic or dense representations. Experimental results showed that the joint AB-LSTM approach outperformed previous approaches, achieving an f-measure of 73.3.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Dados de bases não oficiais",10.1109/JBHI.2018.2879744,adverse drug reaction;algorithm;area under the curve;article;artificial neural network;deep neural network;electronic health record;entropy;long short term memory network;mathematical model;mathematical parameters;memory cell;patient safety;pharmacovigilance;principal component analysis;random forest;receiver operating characteristic;short term memory;software validation;theoretical model;theory validation;training;workload;World Health Organization,,

The lack of readily available EHRs because of confidentiality issues and their lexical variability make the ADR extraction challenging. Furthermore, ADRs are rare events. Therefore, efficient representations against data sparsity are needed. Methods: Embedding-based characterizations are able to group semantically related words. However, dense spaces suffer from data sparsity. We employed context-aware continuous representations to enhance the modelling of infrequent events through their context and we turned to simple smoothing techniques to increase the proximity between similar words (e.g. direction cosines, truncation, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering) in an attempt to cope with data sparsity. Results: An F-measure of 0.639 for the ADR classification was achieved, obtaining an improvement of approximately 0.300 in comparison with the results obtained by a word-based characterization. Conclusion: The embbeding-based representation together with the smoothing techniques increased the robustness of the ADR characterization.

Apart from the conventional ADR information contained in the structured section of ADERs, more detailed information such as pre- and post- ADR symptoms, multi-drug usages and ADR-relief treatments are described in the free-text section, which can be mined through Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools. Objective: The goal of this study was to extract ADR-related entities from free-text section of Chinese ADERs, which can act as supplements for the information contained in structured section, so as to further assist in ADR evaluation. Methods: Three models of Conditional Random Field (CRF), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory-CRF (BiLSTM-CRF) and Lexical Feature based BiLSTM-CRF (LF-BiLSTM-CRF) were constructed to conduct Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks in free-text section of Chinese ADERs. A semi-supervised learning method of tri-training was applied on the basis of the three established models to give un-annotated raw data with reliable tags. Results: Among the three basic models, the LF-BiLSTM-CRF achieved the highest average F1 score of 94.35%. After the process of tri-training, almost half of the un-annotated cases were tagged with labels, and the performances of all the three models improved after iterative training. Conclusions: The LF-BiLSTM-CRF model that we constructed could achieve a comparatively high F1 score, and the fusion of CRF, while BiLSTM-CRF and LF-BiLSTM-CRF in tri-training might further strengthen the reliability of predicted tags. The results suggested the usefulness of our methods in developing the specialized NER tools for identifying ADR-related information from Chinese ADERs.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 69; Correspondence Address: J.

Objective: The objective of our work was to compare the accuracy of both common and innovative methods of data mining for pharmacovigilance purposes. Methods: We used the reference standard provided by the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership, which contains 398 drug–adverse event pairs (165 positive controls, 233 negative controls). Ten methods and algorithms were applied to the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System data to investigate the 398 pairs. The ten methods include popular methods in the pharmacovigilance literature, newly developed pharmacovigilance methods as at 2018, and popular methods in the genome-wide association study literature. We compared their performance using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot, area under the curve (AUC), and Youden’s index. Results: The Bayesian confidence propagation neural network had the highest AUC overall. Monte Carlo expectation maximization, a method developed in 2018, had the second highest AUC and the highest Youden’s index, and performed very well in terms of high specificity. The regression-adjusted gamma Poisson shrinkage model performed best under high-sensitivity requirements. Conclusion: Our results will be useful to help choose a method for a given desired level of specificity.

The present study investigates this potential effect by applying emergent sequential pattern mining techniques to electronic health records. Materials and methods: Using longitudinal medication and diagnosis records from more than 377,000 diabetic patients, in this study, we assessed the possible effect of prescription sequences in developing acute renal failure as a prevalent ADR among this group of patients. Relying on emergent sequential pattern mining, two statistical case-control approaches were designed and employed for this purpose. Results: The results taken from the two employed approaches (i.e. 76.7% total agreement and 68.4% agreement on the existence of some significant effect) provide evidence for the potential effect of prescription sequence on ADRs development evidenced by the discovery that certain sequential patterns occurred more frequently in one group of patients than the other. Conclusion: Given the significant effects shown by our data analyses, we believe that design and implementation of automated clinical decision support systems to constantly monitor patients’ medication transactions (and the sequence in which they are administered) and make appropriate alerts to prevent certain possible ADRs, may decrease ADR occurrences and save lives and money.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Dados de bases não oficiais",10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2019.02.010,acetylsalicylic acid;acute kidney failure;adult;adverse drug reaction;alarm monitoring;article;case control study;ciprofloxacin;clinical decision support system;controlled study;cost control;data mining;data warehouse;diabetic patient;electronic health record;esomeprazole;female;glipizide;human;ibuprofen;insulin;ketorolac;longitudinal study;major clinical study;male;metformin;pantoprazole;paracetamol;prescription;prescription drug;prescription drug monitoring program;priority journal;tacrolimus;vancomycin,,

Therefore, it is of paramount importance to reduce the impact and prevalence of ADEs within the healthcare sector, not only since it will result in reducing human suffering, but also as a means to substantially reduce economical strains on the healthcare system. One approach to mitigate this problem is to employ predictive models. While existing methods have been focusing on the exploitation of static features, limited attention has been given to temporal features. METHODS: In this paper, we present a novel classification framework for detecting ADEs in complex Electronic health records (EHRs) by exploiting the temporality and sparsity of the underlying features. The proposed framework consists of three phases for transforming sparse and multi-variate time series features into a single-valued feature representation, which can then be used by any classifier. Moreover, we propose and evaluate three different strategies for leveraging feature sparsity by incorporating it into the new representation. RESULTS: A large-scale evaluation on 15 ADE datasets extracted from a real-world EHR system shows that the proposed framework achieves significantly improved predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art. Moreover, our framework can reveal features that are clinically consistent with medical findings on ADE detection. CONCLUSIONS: Our study and experimental findings demonstrate that temporal multi-variate features of variable length and with high sparsity can be effectively utilized to predict ADEs from EHRs. Two key advantages of our framework are that it is method agnostic, i.e., versatile, and of low computational cost, i.e., fast; hence providing an important building block for future exploitation within the domain of machine learning from EHRs.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 29; Correspondence Address: I.

This study aimed to apply a biclustering algorithm in the spontaneous reporting system of China and to obtain the optimal parameters. The biclustering algorithm is expected to improve the efficiency of signal evaluation by identifying similar signal groups. Methods: Information component (IC) was the method used for disproportionality analysis. By using IC thresholds of various strengths (0.05–4.00), the original quantitative data matrix was transformed into 80 different binary data matrices, where each cell contained either a 1 or 0. The biclustering results were obtained using a total of 720 Bimax algorithm parameters (minimal number of columns and rows was 3, 4, or 5). Next, the optimal parameters were determined through the comprehensive evaluation of the rank sum ration. Finally, we examined the biclustering results under the optimal parameters and evaluated the effect of biclustering analysis on adverse drug reaction (ADR) data in China. Results: The optimal strength of the IC threshold was 0.80, and the minimum number of rows and columns was 3. After taxonomic evaluation, we also found that 1836 biclusters (42.8%) contained similar drugs or similar ADRs, which accounted for 72.3% of signals unevaluated. Conclusions: Applying biclustering analysis in spontaneous reporting system could provide support in confirming unrecognized ADRs, identifying rare ADRs, and screening drug-ADR pairs, which need more attention.

Research design and methods: We retrieved information from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) over a 13-year period. Reporting odds ratio (ROR) for MS was calculated for each single substance. Disproportionality signals were considered when at least 10 cases were retrieved with a lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) >1. Results: After a customized data-mining process, 3,226 reports of MS were retrieved. ‘Antineoplastic and immunomodulating drugs’ (33% of total reports) were the most frequently reported, with 10 disproportionality signals, including etanercept (445 cases; ROR: 2.48; 95% Cl: 2.24–2.74), adalimumab (329; 2.05; 1.83–2.30), and infliximab (119; 2.25; 1.87–2.70). We also observed signals for drugs acting on hormone balance, bone density, and central nervous system. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that immunomodulatory drugs increase the risk of MS and point out that some other drug classes should be further investigated for this risk.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído",10.1080/14740338.2018.1506763,adalimumab;antineoplastic agent;article;confidence interval;data mining;drug;drug exposure;drug surveillance program;etanercept;Food and Drug Administration;human;immunomodulating agent;infliximab;information retrieval;multiple sclerosis;systematic review;United States,,

Previously, we identified and ontologically modeled over 240 drugs that can induce peripheral neuropathy through mining public drug-related databases and drug labels. However, the ADR mechanisms of these drugs are still unclear. In this study, we aimed to develop an ontology-based literature mining system to identify ADRs from drug labels and to elucidate potential mechanisms of the neuropathy-inducing drugs (NIDs). RESULTS: We developed and applied an ontology-based SciMiner literature mining strategy to mine ADRs from the drug labels provided in the Text Analysis Conference (TAC) 2017, which included drug labels for 53 neuropathy-inducing drugs (NIDs). We identified an average of 243 ADRs per NID and constructed an ADR-ADR network, which consists of 29 ADR nodes and 149 edges, including only those ADR-ADR pairs found in at least 50% of NIDs. Comparison to the ADR-ADR network of non-NIDs revealed that the ADRs such as pruritus, pyrexia, thrombocytopenia, nervousness, asthenia, acute lymphocytic leukaemia were highly enriched in the NID network. Our ChEBI-based ontology analysis identified three benzimidazole NIDs (i.e., lansoprazole, omeprazole, and pantoprazole), which were associated with 43 ADRs. Based on ontology-based drug class effect definition, the benzimidazole drug group has a drug class effect on all of these 43 ADRs. Many of these 43 ADRs also exist in the enriched NID ADR network. Our Ontology of Adverse Events (OAE) classification further found that these 43 benzimidazole-related ADRs were distributed in many systems, primarily in behavioral and neurological, digestive, skin, and immune systems. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that ontology-based literature mining and network analysis can efficiently identify and study specific group of drugs and their associated ADRs. Furthermore, our analysis of drug class effects identified 3 benzimidazole drugs sharing 43 ADRs, leading to new hypothesis generation and possible mechanism understanding of drug-induced peripheral neuropathy.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 7; Correspondence Address: J.

Therefore, clarifying whether an AE is due to a specific suspect drug or drug-drug interaction (DDI) is useful information for proper use of drugs. Whereas previous reports on the search for drug-induced AEs with signal detection using spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs) are numerous, reports on drug interactions are limited. This is because in methods that use ""a safety signal indicator"" (signal), which is frequently used in pharmacovigilance, a huge number of combinations must be prepared when signal detection is performed, and each risk index must be calculated, which makes interaction search appear unrealistic. Objective: In this paper, we propose association rule mining (AR) using large dataset analysis as an alternative to the conventional methods (additive interaction model (AI) and multiplicative interaction model (MI)). Methods: The data source used was the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database. The combination of drugs for which the risk index is detected by the ""combination risk ratio (CR)"" as the target was assumed to be true data, and the accuracy of signal detection using the AR methods was evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, Youden's index, F-score. Results: Our experimental results targeting Stevens-Johnson syndrome indicate that AR has a sensitivity of 99.05%, specificity of 92.60%, Youden's index of 0.917, F-score of 0.876, AI has a sensitivity of 95.62%, specificity of 96.92%, Youden's index of 0.925, and F-score of 0.924, and MI has a sensitivity of 65.46%, specificity of 98.78%, Youden's index of 0.642, and F-score of 0.771. This result was about the same level as or higher than the conventional method. Conclusions: If you use similar calculation methods to create combinations from the database, not only for SJS, but for all AEs, the number of combinations would be so enormous that it would be difficult to perform the calculations. However, in the AR method, the ""Apriori algorithm"" is used to reduce the number of calculations. Thus, the proposed method has the same detection power as the conventional methods, with the significant advantage that its calculation process is simple.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 40; Correspondence Address: Y.

Approximately 50% of digoxin toxicity cases are preventable, which motivated us to improve the treatment outcomes of digoxin. The objective of this study is to apply machine learning techniques to predict the appropriateness of initial digoxin dosage. A total of 307 inpatients who had their conditions treated with digoxin between 2004 and 2013 at a medical center in Taiwan were collected in the study. Ten independent variables, including demographic information, laboratory data, and whether the patients had CHF were also noted. A patient with serum digoxin concentration being controlled at 0.5-0.9 ng/mL after his/her initial digoxin dosage was defined as having an appropriate use of digoxin; otherwise, a patient was defined as having an inappropriate use of digoxin. Weka 3.7.3, an open source machine learning software, was adopted to develop prediction models. Six machine learning techniques were considered, including decision tree (C4.5), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), classification and regression tree (CART), randomForest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and logistic regression (LGR). In the non-DDI group, the area under ROC curve (AUC) of RF (0.912) was excellent, followed by that of MLP (0.813), CART (0.791), and C4.5 (0.784); the remaining classifiers performed poorly. For the DDI group, the AUC of RF (0.892) was the best, followed by CART (0.795), MLP (0.777), and C4.5 (0.774); the other classifiers' performances were less than ideal. The decision tree-based approaches and MLP exhibited markedly superior accuracy performance, regardless of DDI status. Although digoxin is a high-alert medication, its initial dose can be accurately determined by using data mining techniques such as decision tree-based and MLP approaches. Developing a dosage decision support system may serve as a supplementary tool for clinicians and also increase drug safety in clinical practice.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza DM,Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Dados de bases não oficiais",10.1155/2018/3948245,alanine aminotransferase;albumin;article;artificial neural network;aspartate aminotransferase;clinical practice;data mining;decision support system;decision tree;diagnostic accuracy;digitalis intoxication;digoxin;digoxin blood level;drug clearance;drug monitoring;drug safety;hospital patient;hospitalization;human;independent variable;k nearest neighbor;machine learning;medical record;perceptron;personal experience;prediction;Taiwan;treatment outcome;urea nitrogen blood level,,

It is a modern method of detecting new reaction (which can be desired or undesired) of a drug. It facilitates early adverse drug reaction detection which enables health professionals to identify adverse events that may not have been identified in pre-marketing clinical trials. Vortioxetine, the first mixed serotonergic antidepressant was initially approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) on September 30, 2013 for the treatment of adults with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). This study was to identify the signal strength for vortioxetine associated ADRs using data mining technique in USFDA Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) database. Methodology Most commonly used three data mining algorithms, Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) and Information Component (IC) were selected for the study and they were applied retrospectively in USFDA AERS database from 2015Q1 to 2016Q3. A value of ROR-1.96SE > 1, PRR ≥ 2, IC- 2SD > 0 were considered as the positive signal. Result A study population of 61,22,000 were reported all over the world. Among which 3481 reactions were associated with vortioxetine which comprised of 632 unique events encompassed with 27 clinically relevant reactions. ROR, PRR and IC showed positive signal for weight loss, agitation, anger, ketoacidosis, insomnia and abnormal dreams. Conclusion The present study suggests that vortioxetine may result in these adverse events. Further pharmacoepidemiologic studies are necessary to confirm this conclusion and to improve the precision of the prevalence and/or the risk factors of this ADRs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.1016/j.ajp.2017.09.005,abnormal dreaming;agitation;algorithm;anger;article;body weight loss;brintellix;data mining;drug safety;drug surveillance program;human;information component algorithm;insomnia;ketoacidosis;priority journal;proportional reporting ratio algorithm;reporting odds ratio algorithm;signal detection;trintellix;vortioxetine,,

Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of DIGH using spontaneous reporting system (SRS) databases. Methods: We analyzed reports of DIGH from SRS databases and calculated the reporting odds ratios (RORs) of suspected drugs (immunosuppressants, calcium channel blockers, and anticonvulsants). The SRS databases used were the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database. With the data, we evaluated the time-to-onset profile and the hazard type using the Weibull shape parameter (WSP). Furthermore, we used the association rule mining technique to discover undetected relationships such as possible risk factors. Results: The FAERS contained 5,821,716 reports. The RORs (95% confidence interval: CI) for cyclosporine, everolimus, sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, amlodipine, nifedipine, carbamazepine, clobazam, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, topiramate, and valproic acid, were 39.4 (95% CI: 30.3-51.2), 4.2 (1.7-10.0), 6.6 (2.5-17.7), 13.1 (7.2-23.2), 94.8 (80.0-112.9), 57.9 (35.7-94.0), 15.1 (10.3-22.3), 65.4 (33.8-126.7), 6.5 (3.6-11.8), 19.7 (8.8-44.0), 65.4 (52.4-82.9), 56.5 (21.1-151.7), 2.9 (1.1-7.7), and 17.5 (12.6-24.4), respectively. The JADER database contained 430,587 reports. The median time-to-onset of gingival hyperplasia values for immunosuppressants, calcium channel blockers, and anticonvulsants use were 71, 262, and 37 days, respectively. Furthermore, the 95% CI of the WSP β for anticonvulsants was over and excluded 1, which meant that they were wear-out failure type. Conclusions: Our results suggest that DIGH monitoring of patients administered immunosuppressants, calcium channel blockers, or anticonvulsants is important. We demonstrated the potential risk of DIGH following the long-term use of calcium channel blocker over approximately 260 days. Based on the results of the association rule mining approach, patients with intellectual disability who are administered phenytoin should be monitored carefully. We recommend that patients who experience symptoms related to DIGH should be closely monitored.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.1186/s40780-017-0088-5,aclonium;adalat;adalat 10;adonal;aephenal;alboral;aleviatin;aliseum;amlocard;amlodipine;amlodis;anticonvulsive agent;antisacer;apo carbamazepine;apo primidone;article;atretol;avugane;benidipine;calcium channel blocking agent;carbamazepine;cardene;cardene iv;cellcept;certican;chlorepin;clobazam;clorepin;cyclosporine;cyral;data base;data mining;diazepam;drug induced disease;drug induced gingiva hyperplasia;everolimus;excegran;exegram;gabapentin;gengraf;gingiva hyperplasia;human;immunosuppressive agent;incidence;intellectual impairment;Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database;keppra;levetiracetam;lti valproic;mucoloc;mycophenolate mofetil;neoral;neurontin;nicardipine;nifedipine;patient monitoring;phenobarbital;phenytoin;primidone;priority journal;rapamune;retrospective study;risk factor;sirolimus;spontaneous reporting system database;sprinkle;topamax;topiramate;US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System;valproic acid;zonisamide,,

Methods: All reports of serious ADR received by the Catalan Center of Pharmacovigilance in 2014 were analyzed using the VigiGrade and a more clinical and qualitative approach. Results: Up to 824 reports describing serious ADR were included in the study; of them, 503 (61.0%) were sent by health care professionals (HPs) and the remaining 321 (39.0%) came from pharmaceutical companies (PhC). More than 80% of missing variables such as ‘onset date’ or ‘time-to-onset’ of the ADR were from PhCs reports. ‘Onset of treatment date’ was not filled in 28 (22.2%) of the reports including an ‘additional monitoring’ medicine, and ‘end of treatment’ date was not completed in 53 of those reports (42.1%). In summary, 39% of the reports involving a black triangle medicine sent by PhCs lacked some essential information such as the onset date of treatment. Conclusions: More than one third of the reports coming from manufacturers did not include information that is considered a limiting factor to evaluate any causal relationship, and can be an issue for the detection of safety signals. To take advantage of this huge amount of potentially important information that is almost useless at present, data mining tools and new algorithms should be developed and tested with the aim of finding formulas to deal with a huge amount of low quality data without losing it, nor generating a number of false associations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Artigo Teórico,Excluído - Não utiliza DM | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Não aplica técnica de mineração de dados",10.1007/s00228-017-2223-5,adverse drug reaction;aged;article;causality;controlled study;data mining;drug industry;drug surveillance program;female;health care personnel;human;infliximab;major clinical study;male;observational study;priority journal;punishment;signal detection;telaprevir;uncertainty,,

Previous work primarily utilized feature-based pipeline models to process this task. Many efforts need to be made on feature engineering when feature-based models are employed. Moreover, pipeline models may suffer error propagation and are not able to utilize the interactions between subtasks. Therefore, we propose a neural joint model to extract biomedical entities as well as their relations simultaneously, and it can alleviate the problems above.     RESULTS: Our model was evaluated on two tasks, i.e., the task of extracting adverse drug events between drug and disease entities, and the task of extracting resident relations between bacteria and location entities. Compared with the state-of-the-art systems in these tasks, our model improved the F1 scores of the first task by 5.1% in entity recognition and 8.0% in relation extraction, and that of the second task by 9.2% in relation extraction.     CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model achieves competitive performances with less work on feature engineering. We demonstrate that the model based on neural networks is effective for biomedical entity and relation extraction. In addition, parameter sharing is an alternative method for neural models to jointly process this task.

First, we applied a virtual HTDocking platform to predict the potential targets of Kushen related to liver fibrosis by selecting five crucial protein targets based on network parameters and text mining. Then, we identified nine components in mice plasma after oral administration of Kushen extract and determined the plasma concentration of each compound. Binding affinities between the nine potential active compounds and five target proteins were detected by SPR assays. Finally, we constructed a multi-parameter network model on the basis of three important parameters to tentatively explain the anti-fibrosis mechanism of Kushen.

By predicting the drug response to cancer, oncologists gain full understanding of the effective treatments on each patient, which leads to better personalized treatment. In this paper, we present three learning approaches to improve the prediction of breast cancer patients' response to chemotherapy drug: the instance selection approach, the oversampling approach, and the hybrid approach.

Additional prescriptions, however, may worsen the existing condition or introduce additional adverse effects (AEs). Timely detection and prevention of detrimental PCs is essential as drug AEs are among the leading causes of hospitalization and deaths. Identifying detrimental PCs would enable warnings and contraindications to be disseminated and assist the detection of unknown drug AEs. Nonetheless, the detection is difficult and has been limited to case reports or case assessment using administrative health claims data. Social media is a promising source for detecting signals of detrimental PCs due to the public availability of many discussions regarding treatments and drug AEs. Objective In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of detecting detrimental PCs from social media. Methods The detection, however, is challenging due to the data uncertainty and data rarity in social media. We propose a framework to mine sequences of drugs and AEs that signal detrimental PCs, taking into account the data uncertainty and data rarity. Results We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets collected from Twitter and Patient health forum. Our framework achieves encouraging results in the validation against known detrimental PCs (F1 = 78% for Twitter and 68% for Patient) and the detection of unknown potential detrimental PCs (Precision@50 = 72% and NDCG@50 = 95% for Twitter, Precision@50 = 86% and NDCG@50 = 98% for Patient). In addition, the framework is efficient and scalable to large datasets. Conclusion Our study demonstrates the feasibility of generating hypotheses of detrimental PCs from social media to reduce pharmacists’ guesswork.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza DM,Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Dados de bases não oficiais",10.1016/j.artmed.2016.06.002,adverse drug reaction;algorithm;article;binomial distribution;data base;data mining;disease classification;drug;hospitalization;human;hypertension;personal experience;Poisson distribution;prescribing cascade;prescription;priority journal;probability;social media;uncertainty,,

In this paper, we improved the predictive accuracy of PharmMapper by generating a ligand-target pairwise fit score matrix from profiling all the annotated pharmacophore models against corresponding ligands in the original complex structures that were used to extract these pharmacophore models. The matrix reflects the noise baseline of fit score distribution of the background database, thus enabling estimation of the probability of finding a given target randomly with the calculated ligand-pharmacophore fit score.

We performed a quantitative signal detection analysis using data from the Uppsala Monitoring Centre from the WHO that records adverse drug reaction (ADR) data from worldwide sources; we retrieved substance- and country-specific (Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States) ADR data and calculated reporting odds ratios as measures for disproportionality within a case/noncase approach. To allow for identification of agents that cause severe forms of hepatotoxic ADRs, we used 2 terms of the MedDRA (""drug-related hepatic disorders-comprehensive search"" [DRHD-CS] and ""... -severe events only"" [DRHD-SEO]). Distribution of signals was heterogeneous throughout the different data sets, and consistent findings were present for only a few substances: agomelatine (AGM) and tianeptine as well as both positive control agents (amineptine, nefazodone) generated signals related to DRHD-CS and DRHD-SEO in all analyzed data sets. Tri- and tetracyclic antidepressants (here amitriptyline, clomipramine, mianserin, mirtazapine, trimipramine) were associated with hepatotoxicity in several data sets. Using 2 MedDRA terms did not allow for detection of agents that cause severe hepatotoxic ADR. Our results support the findings of previous, primarily literature-based, systematic analyses of hepatotoxicity related to antidepressive psychopharmacotherapy. No new safety information could be generated.

Quantitative methods for analyzing spontaneous reporting material recorded in pharmacovigilance databases through data mining have been proposed in the last decades and are increasingly used to flag potential safety problems. While automated data mining is motivated by the usually huge size of pharmacovigilance databases, it does not systematically produce relevant alerts. Moreover, each detected signal requires appropriate assessment that may involve investigation of the whole therapeutic class. The goal of this article is to provide a methodology for comparing two detected signals. It is nested within the automated surveillance framework as (1) no extra information is required and (2) no simple inference on the actual risks can be extrapolated from spontaneous reporting data. We designed our methodology on the basis of two classical methods used for automated signal detection: the Bayesian Gamma Poisson Shrinker and the frequentist Proportional Reporting Ratio.

Predicting side effects of drugs is a critical issue for the drug discovery. Although several machine-learning methods were proposed to predict the drug side effects, it remains the space for the improvement. To the best of our knowledge, many side effects are not detectable in clinical trials until drugs are approved, thus predicting potential or missing side effects based on the known side effects is important for the postmarketing surveillance. In order to solve this specific problem, we formulate approved drugs, side effect terms and drug-side effect associations as a recommender system, and transform the problem of predicting side effects into a recommender task. Two recommender methods, i.e. the integrated neighborhood-based method and the restricted Boltzmann machine-based method, are designed to make predictions. Further, in order to achieve better performances, we combine proposed methods and existing methods of the same type to develop ensemble models. Compared with benchmark methods, the proposed methods and the ensemble method lead to better performances, and the statistical analysis demonstrates the improvements are significant (. p-value<0.05).

In medical areas, social media allows non-experts to access, interpret, and generate medical information for their own care and the care of others. Researchers paid much attention on social media in medical educations, patient–pharmacist communications, adverse drug reactions detection, impacts of social media on medicine and healthcare, and so on. However, relatively few papers discuss how to extract useful knowledge from a huge amount of textual comments in social media effectively. Therefore, this study aims to propose a Fuzzy adaptive resonance theory network based Information Retrieval (FIR) scheme by combining Fuzzy adaptive resonance theory (ART) network, Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), and association rules (AR) discovery to extract knowledge from social media. In our FIR scheme, Fuzzy ART network firstly has been employed to segment comments. Next, for each customer segment, we use LSI technique to retrieve important keywords. Then, in order to make the extracted keywords understandable, association rules mining is presented to organize these extracted keywords to build metadata. These extracted useful voices of customers will be transformed into design needs by using Quality Function Deployment (QFD) for further decision making. Unlike conventional information retrieval techniques which acquire too many keywords to get key points, our FIR scheme can extract understandable metadata from social media.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Dados de bases não oficiais",10.1007/s10916-015-0333-0,acne;alpha tocopherol;article;artificial neural network;CBA version 2.0;consumer attitude;consumer health information;controlled study;cosmetic;cosmetic industry;data mining;decision making;depigmenting agent;glycerol;human;information processing;information retrieval;medical information system;odor;oil;personal needs;polysorbate 80;potassium derivative;quality function deployment;reading;scoring system;singular value decomposition;skin care;skin color;social marketing;social media;social network;software,,

We mined the approved labels in Drugs@FDA, identified the SJS/TEN list of 259 small molecular drugs and biologics, and conducted systems pharmacological network analyses. Pharmacological network analysis revealed that drugs with treatment-related SJS and/or TEN are pharmacologically diverse and that the largest subnetwork is associated with antiepileptic drugs and their pharmacological targets. Our pharmacological network analysis identified CTNNB1 [catenin (cadherin-associated protein), beta 1, 88 kDa] as a significant intermediator. This protein is involved in maintaining the functional integrity of the epithelium through regulating cell growth and adhesion between cells in various organs, including the skin. Leveraging a publicly accessible genome-wide transcriptional expression database, we found that human leukocyte antigen-related (HLA) genes were significantly perturbed by various SJS/TEN-inducing drugs. Notably, carbamazepine (CBZ) perturbed several HLA genes, among which HLA-DQB1∗0201 was reportedly shown to be associated with CBZ-induced SJS/TEN in caucasians. In short, systems analysis by leveraging a publicly accessible knowledge base and databases could produce meaningful results for further mechanistic investigation.

Method: Pairs of drugs and reasons for hospitalization (generated automatically from the PHARMO record linkage database by using two data mining techniques) were assessed manually to determine whether they represented pharmacologically plausible adverse drug events (PP-ADEs). Two crude samples of these PP-ADEs (from 2005 and 2008) were examined manually to establish causality and preventability on the basis of hospital discharge letters plus medication dispensing data. The results were used to calculate the positive predictive value (PPV) of the crude causality PP-ADEs, the net percentage of possible/probably HARMs, and their potential preventability. Results: Data mining by Gamma Poisson Shrinkage and trend analysis produced 1330 and 2941 significant drug-event pairs, respectively. After manual assessment, 307 different PP-ADEs remained. The annual prevalence of these PP-ADEs was stable at approximately 8% throughout 2000-2009. Manual assessment of two samples of crude PP-ADEs showed that their causality PPV was 53.7% (95%CI: 52.7%-54.7%) in 2005 and 47.9% (95%CI: 46.9%-49.0%) in 2008. The net contribution of possible/probably HARMs to all acute admissions was 4.6% (95%CI: 4.5%-4.8%) in 2005 and 3.9% (95%CI: 3.8%-4.0%) in 2008. The potential preventability of all possible/probably HARMs in the two samples was 19.3% (95%CI: 18.5-20.1). Conclusion: Automated pre-selection of PP-ADEs is an efficient way to monitor crude trends. Further validation and manual assessment of the automatically selected hospitalizations is necessary to get a more detailed and precise picture.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Dados de bases não oficiais",10.1002/pds.3747,"2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative;acute coronary syndrome;alpha adrenergic receptor blocking agent;antivertigo agent;article;benzodiazepine derivative;beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent;bleeding;calcium antagonist;constipation;convulsion;corticosteroid;data base;data mining;diuretic agent;drug surveillance program;electrolyte disturbance;faintness;fever;fracture;heart failure;hospital admission;human;hypotension;ileus;infection;insulin derivative;kidney disease;lung disease;narcotic analgesic agent;nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent;polypharmacy;predictive value;prevalence;priority journal;serotonin uptake inhibitor;software;spironolactone;tricyclic antidepressant agent",,

It is crucial for healthcare professionals to understand the nature and proper use of data available in pharmacovigilance practice. Objectives To (a) compare performance of EU-ADR [electronic healthcare record (EHR) exemplar] and FAERS [spontaneous reporting system (SRS) exemplar] databases in detecting signals using “positive” and “negative” drug-event reference sets; and (b) evaluate the impact of timing bias on sensitivity thresholds by comparing all data to data restricted to the time before a warning/regulatory action. Methods Ten events with known positive and negative reference sets were selected. Signals were identified when respective statistics exceeded defined thresholds. Main outcome measure Performance metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and accuracy were calculated. In addition, the effect of regulatory action on the performance of signal detection in each data source was evaluated. Results The sensitivity for detecting signals in EHR data varied depending on the nature of the adverse events and increased substantially if the analyses were restricted to the period preceding the first regulatory action. Across all events, using data from all years, a sensitivity of 45–73 % was observed for EU-ADR and 77 % for FAERS. The specificity was high and similar for EU-ADR (82–96 %) and FAERS (98 %). EU-ADR data showed range of PPV (78–91 %) and accuracy (78–72 %) and FAERS data yielded a PPV of 97 % with 88 % accuracy. Conclusion Using all cumulative data, signal detection in SRS data achieved higher specificity and sensitivity than EHR data. However, when data were restricted to time prior to a regulatory action, performance characteristics changed in a manner consistent with both the type of data and nature of the ADR. Further research focusing on prospective validation of is necessary to learn more about the performance and utility of these databases in modern pharmacovigilance practice.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Dados de bases não oficiais",10.1007/s11096-014-0044-5,article;data mining;disease course;drug exposure;drug safety;drug surveillance program;electronic medical record;predictive value;priority journal;restriction mapping;risk factor;sensitivity and specificity;signal detection,,

However, several studies have shown that the quality of medical information published online varies drastically whatever the health topic addressed. The aim of this study is to use an existing rating tool on a set of social network web sites in order to assess the capabilities of these tools to guide experts for selecting the most adapted social network web site to mine ADRs.     METHODS: First, we reviewed and rated 132 Internet forums and social networks according to three major criteria: the number of visits, the notoriety of the forum and the number of messages posted in relation with health and drug therapy. Second, the pharmacist reviewed the topic-oriented message boards with a small number of drug names to ensure that they were not off topic. Six experts have been chosen to assess the selected internet forums using a French scoring tool: Net scoring. Three different scores and the agreement between experts according to each set of scores using weighted kappa pooled using mean have been computed.     RESULTS: Three internet forums were chosen at the end of the selection step. Some criteria get high score (scores 3-4) no matter the website evaluated like accessibility (45-46) or design (34-36), at the opposite some criteria always have bad scores like quantitative (40-42) and ethical aspect (43-44), hyperlinks actualization (30-33). Kappa were positives but very small which corresponds to a weak agreement between experts.     CONCLUSION: The personal opinion of the expert seems to have a major impact, undermining the relevance of the criterion.

This study aims to explore the feasibility of using Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to identify additional cases based on initial indications from spontaneous ADR reports, with the goal of strengthening the evidence base for potential safety signals. For two confirmed and two potential signals generated by the SRS of the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb, targeted searches in the EHR of the Leiden University Medical Centre were performed using a text-mining based tool, CTcue. The search for additional cases was done by constructing and running queries in the structured and free-text fields of the EHRs. We identified at least five additional cases for the confirmed signals and one additional case for each potential safety signal. The majority of the identified cases for the confirmed signals were documented in the EHRs before signal detection by the Dutch Medicines Evaluation Board. The identified cases for the potential signals were reported to Lareb as further evidence for signal detection.

Unnecessary use of antibiotics is particularly concerning because antibiotics may be associated with a number of adverse drug events. Aim: The study was designed to detect the association between pulmonary embolism and antibiotics by disproportionality analysis in the Food and Drug Administration database of Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) using data mining algorithms (DMAs). Materials and Methods: A retrospective case/noncase disproportionality analysis was performed in the FAERS database. This study was based on adverse events (AEs) reported to FAERS from 2004 Q1 to 2022 Q3. Reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), and information component (IC) were applied to measure the disproportionality in reporting. A positive signal of increased AE risk was defined as ROR >1, Chi-square >4, PRR R2 with the number of cases >3, and IC >0. Results: Total AEs in the FAERS database from 2004 Q1 to 2022 Q3 were found to be 26,555,430. Among which 80,809 reports of pulmonary embolism were considered. The same were selected for further analysis which showed that 11 antibiotics were reported for pulmonary embolism. The number of reports for minocycline, chloramphenicol, and moxifloxacin was found to be 113, 14, and 179. A significant potential signal was noted for minocycline (ROR – 2.87, Chi-square – 135.95, IC – 1.22), chloramphenicol (ROR – 3.35, Chi-square – 22.80, IC – 0.77), and moxifloxacin (ROR – 2.08, Chi-square – 99.37, IC – 0.83). Conclusion: This study found a statistically significant increased risk of reporting pulmonary embolism with minocycline, chloramphenicol, and moxifloxacin, although a causal relation cannot be definitively established. © 2024 Perspectives in Clinical Research.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: J.

Although various clinical studies have investigated whether a combination of two nephrotoxic drugs has an increased risk of AKI using traditional statistical models such as multivariable logistic regression (MLR), the evaluation metrics have not been evaluated despite the fact that traditional statistical models may over-fit the data. The aim of the present study was to detect drug-drug interactions with an increased risk of AKI by interpreting machine-learning models to avoid overfitting. Methods: We developed six machine-learning models trained using electronic medical records: MLR, logistic least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LLR), random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGB) tree, and two support vector machine models (kernel = linear function and radial basis function). In order to detect drug-drug interactions, the XGB and LLR models that showed good predictive performance were interpreted by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI), respectively. Results: Among approximately 2.5 million patients, 65,667 patients were extracted from the electronic medical records, and assigned to case (N = 5,319) and control (N = 60,348) groups. In the XGB model, a combination of loop diuretic and histamine H2 blocker [mean (|SHAP|) = 0.011] was identified as a relatively important risk factor for AKI. The combination of loop diuretic and H2 blocker showed a significant synergistic interaction on an additive scale (RERI 1.289, 95% confidence interval 0.226–5.591) also in the LLR model. Conclusion: The present population-based case-control study using interpretable machine-learning models suggested that although the relative importance of the individual and combined effects of loop diuretics and H2 blockers is lower than that of well-known risk factors such as older age and sex, concomitant use of a loop diuretic and histamine H2 blocker is associated with increased risk of AKI.

We developed a novel, data-driven, ""dynamic"" reaction picklist to improve allergy documentation in the electronic health record (EHR). Materials and Methods: We split 3 decades of allergy entries in the EHR of a large Massachusetts healthcare system into development and validation datasets. We consolidated duplicate allergens and those with the same ingredients or allergen groups. We created a reaction value set via expert review of a previously developed value set and then applied natural language processing to reconcile reactions from structured and free-text entries. Three association rule-mining measures were used to develop a comprehensive reaction picklist dynamically ranked by allergen. The dynamic picklist was assessed using recall at top k suggested reactions, comparing performance to the static picklist. Results: The modified reaction value set contained 490 reaction concepts. Among 4 234 327 allergy entries collected, 7463 unique consolidated allergens and 469 unique reactions were identified. Of the 3 dynamic reaction picklists developed, the 1 with the optimal ranking achieved recalls of 0.632, 0.763, and 0.822 at the top 5, 10, and 15, respectively, significantly outperforming the static reaction picklist ranked by reaction frequency. Conclusion: The dynamic reaction picklist developed using EHR data and a statistical measure was superior to the static picklist and suggested proper reactions for allergy documentation.

Conducting in-vivo and in-vitro experiments on a vast number of drug combinations incurs astronomical time and cost. To reduce the number of combinations, researchers classify whether drug combinations are synergistic through in-silico methods. Since unstructured data, such as biomedical documents, include experimental types, methods, and results, it can be beneficial extracting features from documents to predict anti-cancer drug combination synergy. However, few studies predict anti-cancer drug combination synergy using document-extracted features. Results: We present a novel approach for anti-cancer drug combination synergy prediction using document-based feature extraction. Our approach is divided into two steps. First, we extracted documents containing validated anti-cancer drug combinations and cell lines. Drug and cell line synonyms in the extracted documents were converted into representative words, and the documents were preprocessed by tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal. Second, the drug and cell line features were extracted from the preprocessed documents, and training data were constructed by feature concatenation. A prediction model based on deep and machine learning was created using the training data. The use of our features yielded higher results compared to the majority of published studies. Conclusions: Using our prediction model, researchers can save time and cost on new anti-cancer drug combination discoveries. Additionally, since our feature extraction method does not require structuring of unstructured data, new data can be immediately applied without any data scalability issues. © 2022, The Author(s).","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: H.-G.

Although several natural language processing (NLP) methods have been proposed to extract such information, many challenges remain. Objective: This study evaluates the feasibility of using NLP and deep learning approaches for extracting and linking drug names and associated attributes identified in clinical free-text notes and presents an extensive error analysis of different methods. This study initiated with the participation in the 2018 National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) shared task on adverse drug events and medication extraction. Methods: The proposed system (DrugEx) consists of a named entity recognizer (NER) to identify drugs and associated attributes and a relation extraction (RE) method to identify the relations between them. For NER, we explored deep learning-based approaches (ie, bidirectional long-short term memory with conditional random fields [BiLSTM-CRFs]) with various embeddings (ie, word embedding, character embedding [CE], and semantic-feature embedding) to investigate how different embeddings influence the performance. A rule-based method was implemented for RE and compared with a context-aware long-short term memory (LSTM) model. The methods were trained and evaluated using the 2018 n2c2 shared task data. Results: The experiments showed that the best model (BiLSTM-CRFs with pretrained word embeddings [PWE] and CE) achieved lenient micro F-scores of 0.921 for NER, 0.927 for RE, and 0.855 for the end-to-end system. NER, which relies on the pretrained word and semantic embeddings, performed better on most individual entity types, but NER with PWE and CE had the highest classification efficiency among the proposed approaches. Extracting relations using the rule-based method achieved higher accuracy than the context-aware LSTM for most relations. Interestingly, the LSTM model performed notably better in the reason-drug relations, the most challenging relation type. Conclusions: The proposed end-to-end system achieved encouraging results and demonstrated the feasibility of using deep learning methods to extract medication information from free-text data. © 2021 JMIR Medical Informatics.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 18; Correspondence Address: G.

Negation detection is a key for decision support systems since negated events (detection of absence of some events) help ascertain current medical conditions. For artificial intelligence, negation detection is a valuable point as it can revert the meaning of a part of a text and, accordingly, influence other tasks such as medical dosage adjustment, the detection of adverse drug reactions or hospital acquired diseases. We focus on negated medical events such as disorders, findings and allergies. From Natural Language Processing (NLP) background, we refer to them as negated medical entities. A novelty of this work is that we approached this task as Named Entity Recognition (NER) with the restriction that just negated medical entities must be recognized (in an attempt to help distinguish them from non-negated ones). Our study is driven with Electronic Health Records (EHRs) written in Spanish. A challenge to cope with is the lexical variability (alternative medical forms, abbreviations, etc.). To this end, we employed an approach based on deep learning. Specifically, the system combines character embeddings to cope with out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to model contextual representations and it makes use of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to classify each medical entity as either negated or not given the contextual dense representation. Moreover, we explored both embeddings created from words and embeddings created from lemmas. The best results were obtained with the lemmatized embeddings. Apparently, this approach reinforced the capability of the LSTMs to cope with the high lexical variability.

If we can detect previously unknown ADRs as quickly as possible, then this information can be provided to the regulators, pharmaceutical companies, and health care organizations, thereby potentially reducing drug-related morbidity and saving lives of many patients. A promising approach for detecting ADRs is to use social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. A high level of correlation between a drug name and an event may be an indication of a potential adverse reaction associated with that drug. Although numerous association measures have been proposed by the signal detection community for identifying ADRs, these measures are limited in that they detect correlations but often ignore causality. Objective: This study aimed to propose a causality measure that can detect an adverse reaction that is caused by a drug rather than merely being a correlated signal. Methods: To the best of our knowledge, this was the first causality-sensitive approach for detecting ADRs from social media. Specifically, the relationship between a drug and an event was represented using a set of automatically extracted lexical patterns. We then learned the weights for the extracted lexical patterns that indicate their reliability for expressing an adverse reaction of a given drug. Results: Our proposed method obtains an ADR detection accuracy of 74% on a large-scale manually annotated dataset of tweets, covering a standard set of drugs and adverse reactions. Conclusions: By using lexical patterns, we can accurately detect the causality between drugs and adverse reaction-related events. © Danushka Bollegala, Simon Maskell, Richard Sloane, Joanna Hajne, Munir Pirmohamed.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 37; Correspondence Address: D.

The aim of this study was to improve the efficiency of full database screening using a prediction model-based approach. Methods: A logistic regression-based prediction model containing 5 candidate predictors was developed and internally validated using the Summary of Product Characteristics as the gold standard for the outcome. All drug-ADR associations, with the exception of those related to vaccines, with a minimum of 3 reports formed the training data for the model. Performance was based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results were compared with the current method of database screening based on the number of previously analyzed associations. Results: A total of 25 026 unique drug-ADR associations formed the training data for the model. The final model contained all 5 candidate predictors (number of reports, disproportionality, reports from healthcare professionals, reports from marketing authorization holders, Naranjo score). The AUC for the full model was 0.740 (95% CI; 0.734–0.747). The internal validity was good based on the calibration curve and bootstrapping analysis (AUC after bootstrapping = 0.739). Compared with the old method, the AUC increased from 0.649 to 0.740, and the proportion of potential signals increased by approximately 50% (from 12.3% to 19.4%).

It has thus become challenging for physicians to identify drugs causing adverse events. This study proposes a novel approach that can improve clinical decision making with recommendations on ADE causative drugs based on patient information, drug information, and previous ADE cases. Materials and Methods: We introduce a personalized and learning approach for detecting drugs with a specific adverse event, where recommendations tailored to each patient are generated using data mining techniques. Recommendations could be improved by learning the associations of patients and ADEs as more ADE cases are accumulated through iterations. After consulting the system-generated recommendations, a physician can alter prescriptions accordingly and report feedback, enabling the system to evolve with actual causal relationships. Results: A prototype system is developed using ADE cases reported over 1.5 years and recommendations obtained from decision tree analysis are validated by physicians. Two representative cases demonstrate that the personalized recommendations could contribute to more prompt and accurate responses to ADEs. Conclusion: The current system where the information of individual drugs exists but is not organized in such a way that facilitates the extraction of relevant information together can be complemented with the proposed approach to enhance the treatment of patients with ADEs.

However, direct access to the underlying data for academic institutions and individual physicians or pharmacists is intricate, and easily employable analysis modes for everyday clinical situations are missing. This underlines the need for a tool to bring pharmacovigilance to the clinics. To address these issues, we have developed OpenVigil FDA, a novel web-based pharmacovigilance analysis tool which uses the openFDA online interface of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to access U.S. American and international pharmacovigilance data from the Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS). OpenVigil FDA provides disproportionality analyses to (i) identify the drug most likely evoking a new adverse event, (ii) compare two drugs concerning their safety profile, (iii) check arbitrary combinations of two drugs for unknown drug-drug interactions and (iv) enhance the relevance of results by identifying confounding factors and eliminating them using background correction. We present examples for these applications and discuss the promises and limits of pharmacovigilance, openFDA and OpenVigil FDA. OpenVigil FDA is the first public available tool to apply pharmacovigilance findings directly to real-life clinical problems.

The authors have developed a data-mining method for systematic, automated detection of ADEs from electronic medical records. Materials and Methods This method uses the text from 9.5 million clinical notes, along with prior knowledge of drug usages and known ADEs, as inputs. These inputs are further processed into statistics used by a discriminative classifier which outputs the probability that a given drug-disorder pair represents a valid ADE association. Putative ADEs identified by the classifier are further filtered for positive support in 2 independent, complementary data sources. The authors evaluate this method by assessing support for the predictions in other curated data sources, including a manually curated, time-indexed reference standard of label change events. Results This method uses a classifier that achieves an area under the curve of 0.94 on a held out test set. The classifier is used on 2 362 950 possible drug-disorder pairs comprised of 1602 unique drugs and 1475 unique disorders for which we had data, resulting in 240 high-confidence, well-supported drug-AE associations. Eighty-seven of them (36%) are supported in at least one of the resources that have information that was not available to the classifier. Conclusion This method demonstrates the feasibility of systematic post-marketing surveillance for ADEs using electronic medical records, a key component of the learning healthcare system. © The Author 2015.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 53; Correspondence Address: G.

We describe a general framework for considering the readiness of AI for PV, followed by some examples of the application of AI to ICSR processing and evaluation in industry and FDA. We conclude that AI can usefully be applied to some aspects of ICSR processing and evaluation, but the performance of current AI algorithms requires a 'human-in-the-loop' to ensure good quality. We identify outstanding scientific and policy issues to be addressed before the full potential of AI can be exploited for ICSR processing and evaluation, including approaches to quality assurance of 'human-in-the-loop' AI systems, large-scale, publicly available training datasets, a well-defined and computable 'cognitive framework', a formal sociotechnical framework for applying AI to PV, and development of best practices for applying AI to PV.

Patients' experiences with drugs that they report on  social media represent a new source of data that may have some value in  postmarketing safety surveillance. OBJECTIVE: A scoping review was undertaken to  explore the breadth of evidence about the use of social media as a new source of  knowledge for pharmacovigilance. METHODS: Daubt et al's recommendations for  scoping reviews were followed. The research questions were as follows: How can  social media be used as a data source for postmarketing drug surveillance? What  are the available methods for extracting data? What are the different ways to use  these data? We queried PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar to extract relevant  articles that were published before June 2014 and with no lower date limit. Two  pairs of reviewers independently screened the selected studies and proposed two  themes of review: manual ADR identification (theme 1) and automated ADR  extraction from social media (theme 2). Descriptive characteristics were  collected from the publications to create a database for themes 1 and 2. RESULTS:  Of the 1032 citations from PubMed and Embase, 11 were relevant to the research  question. An additional 13 citations were added after further research on the  Internet and in reference lists. Themes 1 and 2 explored 11 and 13 articles,  respectively. Ways of approaching the use of social media as a pharmacovigilance  data source were identified. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review noted multiple  methods for identifying target data, extracting them, and evaluating the quality  of medical information from social media. It also showed some remaining gaps in  the field. Studies related to the identification theme usually failed to  accurately assess the completeness, quality, and reliability of the data that  were analyzed from social media. Regarding extraction, no study proposed a  generic approach to easily adding a new site or data source. Additional studies  are required to precisely determine the role of social media in the  pharmacovigilance system.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - REVISÃO | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Dados de bases não oficiais",10.2196/jmir.4304,adverse drug reaction;adverse event;Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/*diagnosis;Humans;Internet;Internet/*statistics & numerical data;pharmacovigilance;Pharmacovigilance;Reproducibility of Results;scoping review;social media;Social Media/*standards;text mining;Web 2.0,,

However, as a relatively new therapeutic agent,  the long-term safety profile and adverse event (AE) profile of BV require further  investigation. This study aimed to identify significant and unexpected AEs  associated with BV using data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)  and the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) databases. METHODS: Data on  BV-related AEs were extracted from the FAERS and JADER databases. Signal  detection was performed using the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and 95% confidence  intervals (95% CI). Risk signals were categorized according to system organ  classes (SOCs) and preferred terms (PTs) as defined by the Medical Dictionary for  Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 26.0. In addition, the onset times of  BV-related AEs were analyzed. RESULTS: Between 2004 and 2023, a total of 19,279  and 2,561 AEs related to BV were recorded in the FAERS and JADER databases,  respectively. At the SOC level, prominent signals in the FAERS database included  blood and lymphatic system disorders, benign, malignant, and unspecified  neoplasms (including cysts and polyps), as well as congenital, familial, and  genetic disorders. In the JADER database, the most notable signals involved  benign, malignant, and unspecified neoplasms, blood and lymphatic system  disorders, and nervous system disorders. At the PT level, the top five signals in  the FAERS database were peripheral motor neuropathy, peripheral sensory  neuropathy, pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, febrile bone marrow aplasia, and  polyneuropathy. Unexpected AEs included febrile bone marrow aplasia and  Guillain-Barré syndrome. In the JADER database, the top five signals included  peripheral motor neuropathy, peripheral sensory neuropathy, bacterial  gastroenteritis, febrile neutropenia and pneumonia, with unexpected AEs such as  left ventricular dysfunction, cardiomegaly, retinal detachment, and marasmus. The  median onset time of AEs was 22 days (interquartile range [IQR] 7-81 days) in  FAERS and 27 days (IQR 7-73 days) in JADER. CONCLUSION: The signal detection  results from the FAERS and JADER databases highlight the importance of monitoring  significant and unexpected AEs associated with BV, particularly in the early  stages of treatment. These findings contribute to enhancing the post-marketing  safety profile of BV and offer valuable insights for clinical risk management  strategies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.1371/journal.pone.0322378,"*Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems/statistics & numerical data;*Brentuximab Vedotin/adverse effects;*Data Mining;*Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/epidemiology;*Immunoconjugates/adverse effects;Databases, Factual;Female;Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy;Humans;Japan/epidemiology;Male;United States;United States Food and Drug Administration",,

There is great promise for new insights into health issues such as  drug side effects and spread of disease, as well as patient experiences of health  conditions and health care. However, this emerging field lacks ethical consensus  and guidance. We aimed to bring together a comprehensive body of opinion, views,  and recommendations in this area so that academic researchers new to the field  can understand relevant ethical issues. Methods: After registration of a protocol  in PROSPERO, three parallel systematic searches were conducted, to identify  academic articles comprising commentaries, opinion, and recommendations on  ethical practice in social media text mining for health research and gray  literature guidelines and recommendations. These were integrated with social  media users' views from qualitative studies. Papers and reports that met the  inclusion criteria were analyzed thematically to identify key themes, and an  overarching set of themes was deduced. Results: A total of 47 reports and  articles were reviewed, and eight themes were identified. Commentators suggested  that publicly posted social media data could be used without consent and formal  research ethics approval, provided that the anonymity of users is ensured,  although we note that privacy settings are difficult for users to navigate on  some sites. Even without the need for formal approvals, we note ethical issues:  to actively identify and minimize possible harms, to conduct research for public  benefit rather than private gain, to ensure transparency and quality of data  access and analysis methods, and to abide by the law and terms and conditions of  social media sites. Conclusion: Although social media text mining can often  legally and reasonably proceed without formal ethics approvals, we recommend  improving ethical standards in health-related research by increasing transparency  of the purpose of research, data access, and analysis methods; consultation with  social media users and target groups to identify and mitigate against potential  harms that could arise; and ensuring the anonymity of social media users.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - REVISÃO | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Revisão",10.3389/fdgth.2020.592237,ethics;health research;natural language processing;social media;text-mining,,

This article describes our participation to the  n2c2 shared-task in extracting relations between medication-related entities in  electronic health records. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We proposed an ensemble  approach for relation extraction and classification between drugs and  medication-related entities. We incorporated state-of-the-art named-entity  recognition (NER) models based on bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM)  networks and conditional random fields (CRF) for end-to-end extraction. We  additionally developed separate models for intra- and inter-sentence relation  extraction and combined them using an ensemble method. The intra-sentence models  rely on bidirectional long short-term memory networks and attention mechanisms  and are able to capture dependencies between multiple related pairs in the same  sentence. For the inter-sentence relations, we adopted a neural architecture that  utilizes the Transformer network to improve performance in longer sequences.  RESULTS: Our team ranked third with a micro-averaged F1 score of 94.72% and  87.65% for relation and end-to-end relation extraction, respectively (Tracks 2  and 3). Our ensemble effectively takes advantages from our proposed models.  Analysis of the reported results indicated that our proposed approach is more  generalizable than the top-performing system, which employs additional training  data- and corpus-driven processing techniques. CONCLUSIONS: We proposed a  relation extraction system to identify relations between drugs and  medication-related entities. The proposed approach is independent of external  syntactic tools. Analysis showed that by using latent Drug-Drug interactions we  were able to significantly improve the performance of non-Drug-Drug pairs in  EHRs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Dados de bases não oficiais",10.1093/jamia/ocz101,"*Deep Learning;*Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions;*Electronic Health Records;*Natural Language Processing;adverse drug events;Drug Interactions;electronic health records;ensemble methods;Humans;Information Storage and Retrieval/*methods;neural networks;Neural Networks, Computer;relation extraction",,

H. and Miwa, Makoto and Ananiadou, Sophia",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: This article describes an ensembling system to automatically extract adverse drug events and drug related entities from clinical narratives, which was  developed for the 2018 n2c2 Shared Task Track 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We  designed a neural model to tackle both nested (entities embedded in other  entities) and polysemous entities (entities annotated with multiple semantic  types) based on MIMIC III discharge summaries. To better represent rare and  unknown words in entities, we further tokenized the MIMIC III data set by  splitting the words into finer-grained subwords. We finally combined all the  models to boost the performance. Additionally, we implemented a featured-based  conditional random field model and created an ensemble to combine its predictions  with those of the neural model. RESULTS: Our method achieved 92.78% lenient micro  F1-score, with 95.99% lenient precision, and 89.79% lenient recall, respectively.  Experimental results showed that combining the predictions of either multiple  models, or of a single model with different settings can improve performance.  DISCUSSION: Analysis of the development set showed that our neural models can  detect more informative text regions than feature-based conditional random field  models. Furthermore, most entity types significantly benefit from subword  representation, which also allows us to extract sparse entities, especially  nested entities. CONCLUSION: The overall results have demonstrated that the  ensemble method can accurately recognize entities, including nested and  polysemous entities. Additionally, our method can recognize sparse entities by  reconsidering the clinical narratives at a finer-grained subword level, rather  than at the word level.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Dados de bases não oficiais",10.1093/jamia/ocz075,"*Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions;*Electronic Health Records;*Natural Language Processing;*Neural Networks, Computer;adverse drug event;electronic health record;Humans;information extraction;Information Storage and Retrieval/*methods;Narration;natural language processing;nested named entity recognition",,

METHODS: In a  cross-sectional study, statin drug-drug interactions were screened from medical  record of 10,506 in-patients treated stored in the clinical data warehouse  ""eHOP."" We screened drug-drug interactions using Theriaque and Micromedex drug  databases. RESULTS: A total of 22.5% of patients were exposed to at least one  statin drug-drug interaction. Given their lipophilicity and CYP3A4 metabolic  pathway, atorvastatin and simvastatin presented a higher prevalence of drug-drug  interactions while fluvastatin presented the lowest prevalence. Up to 1% of the  patients was exposed to a contraindicated drug-drug interaction, the most  frequent drug-drug interaction involving influx-transporter (i.e., OATP1B1)  interactions between simvastatin or rosuvastatin with cyclosporin. The second  most frequent contraindicated drug-drug interaction involved CYP3A4 interaction  between atorvastatin or simvastatin with either posaconazole or erythromycin.  Furthermore, our analysis showed some discrepancies between Theriaque and  Micromedex in the prevalence and the nature of drug-drug interactions.  CONCLUSIONS: Different drug-drug interaction profiles were observed between  statins with a higher prevalence of CYP3A4-based interactions for lipophilic  statins. Analyzing the three most frequent DDIs, the more significant DDIs (level  1: contraindication) were reported for transporter-based DDI involving OATP1B1  influx transporter. These points are of concern to improve prescriptions of  statins.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Dados de bases não oficiais",10.1007/s00228-017-2400-6,"*Data Mining;*Electronic Health Records;*Hospitals, University;Clinical data warehouse;Cross-Sectional Studies;Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/metabolism;Data mining;Data Warehousing;Drug databases;Drug Interactions;Drug transporters;Drug-drug interactions;Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/diagnosis/*epidemiology/metabolism;France/epidemiology;Humans;Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics;Liver-Specific Organic Anion Transporter 1/metabolism;Metabolic enzymes;Pharmacokinetics;Prevalence;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors;Severity of Illness Index;Statins",,

Tasks such as monitoring flu  trends, viral disease outbreaks, medication abuse, and adverse drug reactions are  some examples of studies where data from social media have been exploited. The  focus of this workshop is to explore solutions to three important natural  language processing challenges for domain-specific social media text: (i) text  classification, (ii) information extraction, and (iii) concept normalization. To  explore different approaches to solving these problems on social media data, we  designed a shared task which was open to participants globally. We designed three  tasks using our in-house annotated Twitter data on adverse drug reactions. Task 1  involved automatic classification of adverse drug reaction assertive user posts;  Task 2 focused on extracting specific adverse drug reaction mentions from user  posts; and Task 3, which was slightly ill-defined due to the complex nature of  the problem, involved normalizing user mentions of adverse drug reactions to  standardized concept IDs.

In such online conversations, patients discuss their symptoms, medical history,  and diseases. These disorders may correspond to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) or  any other medical condition. Therefore, methods must be developed to distinguish  between false positives and true ADR declarations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this  study was to investigate a method for filtering out disorder terms that did not  correspond to adverse events by using the distance (as number of words) between  the drug term and the disorder or symptom term in the post. We hypothesized that  the shorter the distance between the disorder name and the drug, the higher the  probability to be an ADR. METHODS: We analyzed a corpus of 648 messages  corresponding to a total of 1654 (drug and disorder) pairs from 5 French forums  using Gaussian mixture models and an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm .  RESULTS: The distribution of the distances between the drug term and the disorder  term enabled the filtering of 50.03% (733/1465) of the disorders that were not  ADRs. Our filtering strategy achieved a precision of 95.8% and a recall of 50.0%.  CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that such distance between terms can be used for  identifying false positives, thereby improving ADR detection in social media.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Dados de bases não oficiais",10.2196/publichealth.6577,clustering;density estimation;EM algorithm;Gaussian mixture model;pharmacovigilance;social media;text mining,,

Real-world data mining on the paediatric population showed potential  associations between antibiotic use and acute liver injury. OBJECTIVE: We  assessed risk estimates of liver injury associated with antibiotic use in  children and adolescent outpatients. METHODS: A large, multi-database,  population-based, case-control study was performed in people <18 years of age  from two European countries (Italy and The Netherlands) during the period  2000-2008. All potential cases of liver injury were automatically extracted from  three databases and then manually validated based on Council for International  Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) criteria and by exclusion of all  competing causes for liver injury. Up to 100 control participants were sampled  for each case and were matched on index date of the event, age, sex and database.  Based on prescription data, antibiotic exposure was categorized as current,  recent or past use by calculating the time period between the end of prescription  and the index date. Multivariate conditional logistic regression analyses were  applied to calculate odds ratios (ORs) as a measure of the association (with 95%  confidence interval [CI]). RESULTS: We identified 938 cases of liver injury and  matched to 93,665 controls. Current use of overall antibiotics is associated with  a threefold increased risk of liver injury compared with past use (adjusted OR  [OR(adj)] 3.22, 95% CI 2.57-4.03). With regard to individual antibiotics, the  risk is significantly increased for current use of each antibiotic (p < 0.005),  except for azithromycin. Risk estimates vary from the lowest OR(adj) of 1.86 (95%  CI 1.08-3.21) for amoxicillin to the highest OR(adj) of 24.16 (95% CI  11.78-49.54) for cotrimoxazole (i.e. sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim) and 26.70  (95% CI 12.09-58.96) for ceftriaxone. Sensitivity analyses confirm the  associations for ceftriaxone, cotrimoxazole, and clarithromycin. CONCLUSION:  Antibiotic-induced liver injury in children is heterogeneous across the use of  individual antibiotics. When prescribing ceftriaxone, cotrimoxazole and  clarithromycin in children, paediatricians should definitely be aware of their  potential risk of liver injury, even if for short periods.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Dados de bases não oficiais",10.1007/s40264-016-0493-y,"Adolescent;Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects;Case-Control Studies;Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/epidemiology/*etiology;Child;Child, Preschool;Data Mining/*methods;Databases, Factual/*statistics & numerical data;Female;Humans;Infant;Logistic Models;Male;Multivariate Analysis;Primary Health Care;Risk Assessment/methods",,

Conducting data mining on adverse events (AEs) of cilostazol in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database to explore its potential medication risks and advance more rational and secure clinical medication practices. Methods This study utilized the Open Vigil 2.1-MedDRA tool to retrieve and extract AE reporting data related to cilostazol from the FAERS database spanning the first quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2024. The primary methodology employed was the application of the reporting odds ratio (ROR) method to detect risk signals associated with AEs of cilostazol. Results A total of 2,130 AE reports involving cilostazol were identified as the primary suspect drug, with a total of 7,134 AEs reported. These reports were predominantly concentrated among patients aged 60 and above, with a higher occurrence in males compared to females. Japan ranked first among the reporting countries, and the majority of reports were submitted by healthcare professionals. Through the screening of cilostazol, a total of 323 positive risk signals for AEs were identified, encompassing 23 system organ classes (SOCs). A comparison with the existing cilostazol product label revealed 8 AEs that were not included based on the number of AE reports, and 19 AEs that were not included based on the strength of the risk signals. Cilostazol exhibited positive risk signals for AEs primarily affecting 8 organ systems based on the SOC classification. Among these, cardiac disorders ranked highest, with a total of 53 positive risk signals for cardiovascular-related AEs identified. In terms of the number of reports, cardiac failure ranked first, aligning with the black box warning issued by the FDA regarding cilostazol. The occurrence of adverse reactions related to cilostazol is primarily concentrated within the first month of treatment. However, a certain proportion of adverse reactions have been reported to occur after long-term use (exceeding 360 days) of cilostazol therapy. Conclusion Our results have further enriched the observations from existing clinical and real-world studies, uncovering new AE signals for cilostazol, including fall, cerebral infarction, pneumonia, loss of consciousness, acute kidney injury, renal impairment, renal failure, cardiac vein perforation, basal ganglia haematoma, cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome, et al. This study also highlights the significant impact of cilostazol on the cardiovascular system, necessitating close attention to potential cardiovascular toxicities. In addition to focusing on the short-term adverse reactions following cilostazol administration, thorough research into its long-term safety profile is also imperative. This study provides recommendations and guidance for the rational and safe clinical use of cilostazol. In the future, prospective studies are needed to explore the occurrence of related AEs further.

This study aimed to identify potential adverse events following rotavirus vaccination in infants. Using a nationwide linked database of the national immunization registry and health insurance claims data, we identified infants vaccinated with the first dose of rotavirus vaccine between January 2016 and October 2022. The self-controlled tree‐temporal scan statistics method analyzed all incident diagnoses recorded within 56 days post-vaccination and evaluated all temporal risk windows. Among 1,720,778 rotavirus vaccine recipients 64,752 infants contributed to the analysis, yielding 72,970 incident diagnoses. Of these, 28 clusters were categorized as known adverse drug reactions (ADRs), including infection following immunization (Days 1–2, p<.001), viral infection (Days 1–5, p<.001), urticaria and erythema (Days 3–9, p<.001), acute upper respiratory infections (Days 28–42, p<.001), and pneumonia (Days 9–19 or 28–42, p<.001). Seventeen clusters were classified as ADR-related events, such as the ones clinically related to ADR or lower-level diagnostic codes of ADR. The remaining 26 clusters were classified as signals, including sepsis (Days 1–20, p<.001), meningitis (Days 1–23, p<.001), liver disease (Days 4–11, p<.001), and tubulo-interstitial nephritis (Days 11–38, p<.001). A cluster of intussusceptions was only found in monovalent vaccine-stratified analysis (Days 5–8, p = 0.005). This study confirmed known ADRs following rotavirus vaccination, while identifying potential safety signals requiring further investigation. These findings emphasize the importance of active vaccine surveillance and underscore the need for epidemiological studies with validated outcome definitions to confirm causal relationships between rotavirus vaccination and the detected outcomes. © 2025 The Author(s).

However, few epidemiological studies have investigated the risk, clinical features, and outcomes of AKI caused by different GLP-1RA. In this study, Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) data were used to compare the association between different GLP-1RA and AKI in the real world. Methods: FAERS data from January 2004 to December 2021 were mined using disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis to determine the correlation between different GLP-1RA and AKI, and the onset time, mortality, and hospitalization rate of different GLP-1RA were analyzed. Results: We identified 2670 cases of AKI events associated with GLP-1RA, of which liraglutide was the most commonly reported (34.98%). The patients with AKI were mainly males (47.94%), and the age group was mainly 45-84 years old (73.15%). obese patients with weight more than 99kg (24.42%) were more likely to have AKI. According to different signal mining methods, reporting odds ratio (ROR) (1.50, 95% confidence interval =1.41-1.60) and Bayesian confidence Propagation neural network (0.57, 95% confidence interval =0.54), liraglutide was more strongly associated with AKI than other GLP-1RA. The median time to onset of AKI was 63 days [quartile range (IQR): 15-458.5 days]. In addition, the hospitalization rate and fatality rate of patients with GLP-1RA-related AKI were 45.28% and 4.23% respectively. Conclusions: Based on the data in the FAERS database, we analyzed the risk, onset time, and adverse reaction outcomes of GLP-1RA-induced AKI in detail. The results showed that liraglutide had the highest risk of AKI.

Administration of statin therapy could reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease in individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), which was recognized by multipal clinical guidelines. But previous studies had conflicting results on whether the long-term use of statins could benefit the renal function in diabetic patients. Aim: To evaluate the association between statin treatment and Chronic Kidney Disease in DM patients. Methods: This is a retrospective disproportionality analysis and cohort study based on real-world data. All DM cases reported in US Food and Drug Administration adverse event reporting system (FAERS) between the first quarter of 2004 and the fourth quarter of 2022 were included. Disproportionality analyses were conducted by estimating the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and the information component (IC). We further compared the CKD odds ratio (OR) between the statins group and the other primary suspected drug group among the included diabetes mellitus cases. Results: We finally included 593647 DM cases from FAERS, 5113 (5.31%) CKD cases in the statins group and 8810 (1.77%) CKD cases in the control group. Data analysis showed that the statins group showed a significant CKD signal (ROR: 3.11, 95% CI: 3.00–3.22; IC: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.07–1.29). In case group with two or more statins treatment history, the CKD signal was even stronger (ROR: 19.56, 95% CI: 18.10–21.13; IC: 3.70, 95% CI:3.44–3.93) compared with cases with one statin treatment history. Conclusion: The impact of statin therapy on the progression of renal disease in individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) remains inconclusive. After data mining on the current FAERS dataset, we discovered significant signals between statin treatment and CKD in diabetic patients. Furthermore, the incidence rate of CKD was higher among DM patients who used statins compared to those who did not.

Due to the limited literature on voluntarily reported safety outcomes for recently approved antidiabetic drugs, this study investigated adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Research Design and Methods: A disproportionality analysis of spontaneously reported ADRs was conducted. FAERS reports from January 1, 2012 to March 31, 2022 were compiled, allowing a 5-year buffer following drug approval in 2017. Reporting odds ratios were calculated for the top 10 ADRs, comparing new diabetic agents to the other approved drugs in their therapeutic class. Results: 127,525 reports were identified for newly approved antidiabetic medications listed as the primary suspect (PS). For sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, the odds of blood glucose increased, nausea, and dizziness being reported was greater for empagliflozin. Dapagliflozin was associated with greater reports of weight decreased. Canagliflozin was found to have a disproportionally higher number of reports for diabetic ketoacidosis, toe amputation, acute kidney injury, fungal infections, and osteomyelitis. Assessing glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, dulaglutide and semaglutide were associated with greater reports of gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions. Exenatide was disproportionally associated with injection site reactions and pancreatic carcinoma reports. Conclusion: Pharmacovigilance studies utilizing a large publicly available dataset allow an essential opportunity to evaluate the safety profile of antidiabetic drugs utilized in clinical practice. Additional research is needed to evaluate these reported safety concerns for recently approved antidiabetic medications to determine causality. © The Author(s), 2023.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 15; Correspondence Address: S.L.

This study aimed to assess the safety of cyclosporine through the analysis of adverse events (AEs) related to cyclosporine in the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). To detect AEs associated with cyclosporine, a pharmacovigilance analysis was conducted using four algorithms on the FAERS database: reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), and empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM). A statistical analysis was performed on data extracted from the FAERS database, covering 19,582 case reports spanning from 2013 to 2022. Among these cases, 3,911 AEs were identified, with 476 linked to cyclosporine as the primary suspected drug. Cyclosporin-induced AEs targeted 27 System Organ Classes (SOCs). Notably, the highest case at the SOC level included eye disorders, injury, poisoning, and procedural complications, as well as immune system disorders, all of which are listed on the cyclosporine label. Furthermore, we discovered novel potential AEs associated with hepatobiliary disorders, among others. Moreover, unexpected adverse drug reactions (ADRs), such as biliary anastomosis complication and spermatozoa progressive motility decrease, were identified. Importantly, these newly identified ADRs were not mentioned on the cyclosporine label, which were involved in injury, poisoning, and procedural complications, and investigations at the SOC level. The study used pharmacovigilance analysis of FAERS database to identify new and unexpected potential ADRs relating to cyclosporine, which can provide safety tips for the safe use of cyclosporine. © 2024, Associacao Brasileira de Divulgacao Cientifica.

However, off-target effects may lead to severe adverse events. This study evaluated the neurotoxicity of ADCs using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. Research design and methods: Data were extracted from the FAERS database for 2004 Q1 to 2022 Q4. We analysed the clinical characteristics of ADC-related neurological adverse events (AEs). We used the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and proportional reporting ratio (PRR) for the disproportionality analysis to evaluate the potential association between AEs and ADCs. Results: A total of 562 cases of neurological AEs were attributed to ADCs. The median age was 65 years old [(Min; Max) = 3; 92]. Neurotoxic signals were detected in patients receiving brentuximab vedotin, enfortumab vedotin, polatuzumab vedotin, trastuzumab emtansine, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, inotuzumab ozogamicin, and trastuzumab deruxtecan. The payloads of brentuximab vedotin, enfortumab vedotin, polatuzumab vedotin, and trastuzumab emtansine were microtubule polymerization inhibitors, which are more likely to develop neurotoxicity. We also found that brentuximab vedotin- and gemtuzumab ozogamicin-related neurological AEs were more likely to result in serious outcomes. The eight most common ADC-related nervous system AE signals were peripheral neuropathy [ROR (95% CI) = 16.98 (14.94–19.30), PRR (95% CI) = 16.0 (14.21–18.09)], cerebral haemorrhage [ROR (95% CI) = 9.45 (7.01–12.73), PRR (95% CI) = 9.32 (6.95–12.50)], peripheral sensory neuropathy [ROR (95% CI) = 47.87 (33.13–69.19), PRR (95% CI) = 47.43 (32.93–68.30)], polyneuropathy [ROR (95% CI) = 26.01 (18.61–36.33), PRR (95% CI) = 25.75 (18.50–35.86)], encephalopathy [ROR (95% CI) = 5.16 (3.32–8.01), PRR (95% CI) = 5.14 (3.32–7.96)], progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [ROR (95% CI) = 22.67 (14.05–36.58), PRR (95% CI) = 22.52 (14.01–36.21)], taste disorder [ROR (95% CI) = 26.09 (15.92–42.76), PRR (95% CI) = 25.78 (15.83–42.00)], and guillain barrier syndrome [ROR (95% CI) = 17.844 (10.11–31.51), PRR (95% CI) = 17.79 (10.09–31.35)]. The mortality rate appeared to be relatively high concomitantly with AEs in the central nervous system. Conclusion: ADCs may increase the risk of neurotoxicity in cancer patients, leading to serious mortality. With the widespread application of newly launched ADC drugs, combining the FAERS data with other data sources is crucial for monitoring the neurotoxicity of ADCs. Further studies on the potential mechanisms and preventive measures for ADC-related neurotoxicity are necessary.

However, the long-term safety of rucaparib in large sample population was unknown. The presented study aimed to evaluate rucaparib-associated adverse events (AEs) according to the real-world pharmacovigilance database. Methods: Disproportionality analysis was conducted to assess the association between rucaparib and its AEs. Data were collected from the international pharmacovigilance database of US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) between January 2017 and June 2022. The characteristics of rucaparib-related AEs, and the onset time were further analyzed. Results: A total of 9,296,694 AE reports were recorded in the FAERS during the study period, among which 7,087 reports were associated with rucaparib. About 135 rucaparib-related AE signals in 15 system organ class (SOCs) were identified. The most common AEs included anaemia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, blood creatinine increase, alanine aminotransferase increase, and aspartate aminotransferase increase, which were listed in the label for rucaparib. Of note, 21 new and unexpected significant AEs that off-label were also found in our study, such as preferred term (PTs) of intestinal obstruction, gastrooesophageal reflux disease, blood iron decreased, dehydration, and hypersomnia. The median onset time of rucaparib-related AEs was 12 days (interquartile range [IQR] 1–62 days), and had early failure types.

Methods: All cases of anxiolytic-induced TdP (n = 260) between 1990 and 2020 were retrieved from the FAERS database using the Preferred Term ‘Torsade de Pointes, code: 10044066’ from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA version 22). Four data-mining algorithms were used for disproportionality analysis: Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Empirical Bayes Geometric Mean (EBGM), and Information Content (IC). Anxiolytics with ≥3 TdP cases were included. Results: Of a total of eight drugs, this study identified seven signals of TdP, of which six signals were new, namely for alprazolam, bromazepam, lorazepam, meprobamate, midazolam, and oxazepam. Based on disproportionality analysis, among new signals, the highest risk of TdP was observed with bromazepam and midazolam. Alprazolam showed the lowest risk for TdP, while diazepam did not reach significant disproportionality. Conclusions: This study identified six new signals of TdP among anxiolytic drugs, so warranting stringent clinical studies to ascertain the actual risk of TdP and ensure patient safety.

However, ensuring the safety of GnRHas in real-world applications requires continuous vigilance. In light of this, we undertook a disproportionality analysis focused on adverse events (AEs) associated with GnRHas using data from both the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER). We evaluated GnRHas-associated AEs and characterized the clinical priority of unlisted AEs caused by each GnRHa from the different databases. Methods: In the disproportionality analysis, we applied two adjusted algorithms to identify signals related to GnRHas in the FAERS and JADER databases from 2004 to 2023. Additionally, we utilized the Statistical Analysis System (SAS, 9.4) to examine potential and high-aROR (adjusted reporting odds ratio) signals associated with GnRHas. We performed clinical priority assessment for suspicious PTs and an analysis of serious/non-serious outcomes. We also gathered information on the onset times of AEs linked with GnRHas from both databases. Results: From January 2004 to September 2023, FAERS and JADER recorded a total of 50,360,413 and 1,440,200 AEs, respectively. Employing two algorithms, the suspicious preferred terms (PTs) related to leuprolide (Leu) were 562 potential PTs (44 unlisted in specifications), followed by goserelin (Gos) with 189 PTs (28 unlisted), triptorelin (Tri) with 172 PTs (28 unlisted), and Leu-JADER with 85 PTs (10 unlisted). At the same PT level, the differences in GnRHas between the two databases were observed, such as cardiac failure, diabetes mellitus, liver disorder, dementia, suicidal ideation, interstitial lung disease, urinary disorders, and hypertensive crisis. In an analysis of serious vs. non-serious outcomes, a total of 43 AEs of Leu were more likely to be reported as serious AEs with p < 0.05 (such as asthenia, urinary retention, diabetes mellitus, interstitial lung disease, gait disturbance, and so on), following by Tri (6 AEs), and Gos (4 AEs). Based on the clinical priority score, 41 PTs of Leu, 26 PTs of Tri, 24 PTs of Gos, and 8 PTs of Leu-JADER were graded as weak. There were 3 PTs of Leu, 2 PTs of Tri, 4 PTs of Gos, and 2 PTs of Leu-JADER that were graded as moderate. Notably, in the assessment of the relevant evidence, 2 PTs (loss of libido and urinary tract toxicity caused by Leu), 1 PT (electrolyte imbalance caused by Tri), and 2 PTs (anorexia and suicidal ideation caused by Gos) showed a strong level of evidence with “++.” The differences in the signal strength of the same PTs from two databases were also worth noting. Moreover, the median onset time for GnRHas (Leu, Tri, and Gos) was 23 days (0, 298), 22 days (0, 181), and 217 days (29, 706), respectively, as median (Q1, Q3). Conclusion: An examination of two databases revealed suspicious AEs associated with GnRHas. Our study found potential new AE signals of GnRHas and supported continuous clinical monitoring, pharmacovigilance, regional differences, and further studies of GnRHas.

However, low efficacy, off-target delivery, time consumption, and high cost impose a hurdle and challenges that impact drug design and discovery. Further, complex and big data from genomics, proteomics, microarray data, and clinical trials also impose an obstacle in the drug discovery pipeline. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technology play a crucial role in drug discovery and development. In other words, artificial neural networks and deep learning algorithms have modernized the area. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been implemented in several drug discovery processes such as peptide synthesis, structure-based virtual screening, ligand-based virtual screening, toxicity prediction, drug monitoring and release, pharmacophore modeling, quantitative structure–activity relationship, drug repositioning, polypharmacology, and physiochemical activity. Evidence from the past strengthens the implementation of artificial intelligence and deep learning in this field. Moreover, novel data mining, curation, and management techniques provided critical support to recently developed modeling algorithms. In summary, artificial intelligence and deep learning advancements provide an excellent opportunity for rational drug design and discovery process, which will eventually impact mankind. Graphic abstract: The primary concern associated with drug design and development is time consumption and production cost. Further, inefficiency, inaccurate target delivery, and inappropriate dosage are other hurdles that inhibit the process of drug delivery and development. With advancements in technology, computer-aided drug design integrating artificial intelligence algorithms can eliminate the challenges and hurdles of traditional drug design and development. Artificial intelligence is referred to as superset comprising machine learning, whereas machine learning comprises supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Further, deep learning, a subset of machine learning, has been extensively implemented in drug design and development. The artificial neural network, deep neural network, support vector machines, classification and regression, generative adversarial networks, symbolic learning, and meta-learning are examples of the algorithms applied to the drug design and discovery process. Artificial intelligence has been applied to different areas of drug design and development process, such as from peptide synthesis to molecule design, virtual screening to molecular docking, quantitative structure–activity relationship to drug repositioning, protein misfolding to protein–protein interactions, and molecular pathway identification to polypharmacology. Artificial intelligence principles have been applied to the classification of active and inactive, monitoring drug release, pre-clinical and clinical development, primary and secondary drug screening, biomarker development, pharmaceutical manufacturing, bioactivity identification and physiochemical properties, prediction of toxicity, and identification of mode of action.

Studies suggested conflicting results between PPI treatment and dementia event. This study examined the association between six PPI agents and dementia event by mining the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database from 2004 to 2020. We employed proportional reporting ratio (PRR) and information element (IC) methods to detect the signals of dementia relevant to PPI. We also analyzed characteristics of PPI and positive control reports, compared dementia event between long- and short-duration of PPI treatment. Finally, we identified 2396 dementia cases with PPI treatment. We did not detect significant signal between PPI and dementia event: PRR = 0.98, 95%CI 0.94 to 1.02, IC = −0.03, 95%CI − 0.17 to 0.10, even in gastroesophageal reflux disease cases: PRR = 0.65, 95%CI 0.59 to 0.72, IC = −0.62, 95%CI − 0.97 to − 0.27. No significant differences of dementia event were detected between long- and short- duration groups, the OR (95%CI) of the 3 years, 5 years and 10 years comparison were 0.70 (0.48 to 1.02), 0.72 (0.45 to 1.15) and 1.65 (0.75 to 3.63), respectively.

This study aims to compare and appraise the performance of data mining algorithms used in signal detection. Method: Most commonly used three data mining algorithms (DMAs) (Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) and Information Component (IC)) were selected and applied retrospectively in USFDA Adverse Event Reporting System database to detect five confirmed Drug Event Combinations. They were selected in such a way that the drug is withdrawn from the market or label change between 2006-2015. A value of ROR-1.96SE>1, PRR≥2, χ2>4 or IC- 2SD>0 were considered as the positive signal. The data mining algorithms were compared for their sensitivity and early detection. Result: Among the three data mining algorithms, Information Component was found to have a maximum sensitivity (100%) followed by Reporting Odds Ratio (60%) and Proportional Reporting Ratio (40%). Sensitivity associated with the number of reports per drug event combination and early signal detection suggested that information component needs comparatively fewer reports to show positive signal than the other two data mining algorithms. ROR and PRR showed comparable results. Conclusion: Early detection of a reaction is possible using signal detection technique. Information component was found to be sensitive method compared with other two data mining algorithms in FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database. As the number of reports of drug event combination increased, the sensitivity and comparability of data mining algorithm also increased. © 2018 EManuscript Technologies.

The clinical trials that are undertaken to assess medicine efficacy and safety prior to marketing, generally, may provide sufficient samples for discovering common ADEs. However, more samples are needed to detect infrequent and rare events. Additionally, clinical trials may not include all subgroups of patients. For these reasons, post-marketing surveillance of medicines is necessary for identifying drug safety issues. Most regulatory agencies use the Spontaneous Reporting Systems to identify associations between medicines and suspected ADEs. Data mining with effective analytical frameworks and large-scale medical data is potentially an alternative method to discover and monitor ADEs. In the present paper, we aim to detect potential ADEs from prescription data by discovering ADE associated prescription sequences. In an ADE associated prescription sequence 〈Dp→Ds〉 the prior medicine Dp leads to an ADE for which the succeeding medicine Ds is dispensed to treat. We propose a data-driven method which integrates (1) a constrained sequential pattern mining to uncover prescription sequences as potential signals of ADEs, (2) domain constraints to eliminate interference signals and (3) an adapted Self-Controlled Case Series model to evaluate the potential signals of ADEs. Despite ample prior works using Electronic Health Records (EHRs), our method utilises pure prescription data which does not contain additional information, e.g. symptoms or diagnoses as included in EHRs. To assess the performance of the proposed method, we apply it to a real-world dataset from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme of Australia. The dataset contains over 50 million records covering approximately 2 million patients. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in identifying both known ADEs and unknown yet suspicious ADEs with limited detection of false positive signals. Comparing to a recognised gold standard, our method successfully detects 67.4% of the positive adverse events while only 8.78% false positives exist. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 9; Correspondence Address: C.

The electronic medical record (EMR) database and the FDA's adverse event reporting system (FAERS) database are the major data sources for mining and testing the ADE associated DDI signals. Most DDI data mining methods focus on pair-wise drug interactions, and methods to detect high-dimensional DDIs in medical databases are lacking. In this paper, we propose 2 novel mixture drug-count response models for detecting high-dimensional drug combinations that induce myopathy. The “count” indicates the number of drugs in a combination. One model is called fixed probability mixture drug-count response model with a maximum risk threshold (FMDRM-MRT). The other model is called count-dependent probability mixture drug-count response model with a maximum risk threshold (CMDRM-MRT), in which the mixture probability is count dependent. Compared with the previous mixture drug-count response model (MDRM) developed by our group, these 2 new models show a better likelihood in detecting high-dimensional drug combinatory effects on myopathy. CMDRM-MRT identified and validated (54; 374; 637; 442; 131) 2-way to 6-way drug interactions, respectively, which induce myopathy in both EMR and FAERS databases. We further demonstrate FAERS data capture much higher maximum myopathy risk than EMR data do. The consistency of 2 mixture models' parameters and local false discovery rate estimates are evaluated through statistical simulation studies.

However, few of knowledge resources cover the severity information of ADEs that is critical for prioritizing the medical need. The objective of the study is to develop and evaluate a Semantic Web-based approach for mining severe DDI-induced ADEs. Methods: We utilized a normalized FDA Adverse Event Report System (AERS) dataset and performed a case study of three frequently prescribed cardiovascular drugs: Warfarin, Clopidogrel and Simvastatin. We extracted putative DDI-ADE pairs and their associated outcome codes. We developed a pipeline to filter the associations using ADE datasets from SIDER and PharmGKB. We also performed a signal enrichment using electronic medical records (EMR) data. We leveraged the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) grading system and classified the DDI-induced ADEs into the CTCAE in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Results: We identified 601 DDI-ADE pairs for the three drugs using the filtering pipeline, of which 61 pairs are in Grade 5, 56 pairs in Grade 4 and 484 pairs in Grade 3. Among 601 pairs, the signals of 59 DDI-ADE pairs were identified from the EMR data. Conclusions: The approach developed could be generalized to detect the signals of putative severe ADEs induced by DDIs in other drug domains and would be useful for supporting translational and pharmacovigilance study of severe ADEs. © 2015 Jiang et al.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 18; Correspondence Address: G.

However, limited information is available regarding its real-world adverse reactions. Therefore, this study aimed to assess and evaluate etoposide-related adverse events in a real-world setting by using data mining method on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database.Methods: Through the analysis of 16,134,686 reports in the FAERS database, a total of 9,892 reports of etoposide-related adverse drug events (ADEs) were identified. To determine the significance of these ADEs, various disproportionality analysis algorithms were applied, including the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), and the multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS) algorithms.Results: As a result, 478 significant disproportionality preferred terms (PTs) that were identified by all four algorithms were retained. These PTs included commonly reported adverse events such as thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, anemia, stomatitis, and pneumonitis, which align with those documented in the drug's instructions and previous clinical trials. However, our analysis also uncovered unexpected and significant ADEs, including thrombotic microangiopathy, ototoxicity, second primary malignancy, nephropathy toxic, and ovarian failure. Furthermore, we examined the time-to-onset (TTO) of these ADEs using the Weibull distribution test and found that the median TTO for etoposide-associated ADEs was 10 days (interquartile range [IQR] 2-32 days). The majority of cases occurred within the first month (73.8%) after etoposide administration. Additionally, our analysis revealed specific high-risk signals for males, such as pneumonia and cardiac infarction, while females showed signals for drug resistance and ototoxicity.Discussion: These findings provide valuable insight into the occurrence of ADEs following etoposide initiation, which can potentially support clinical monitoring and risk identification efforts.","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;20<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;20<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;99</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.3389/fphar.2023.1259908,adverse drug event;CELL-LUNG-CANCER;COLONY-STIMULATING FACTORS;DISPROPORTIONALITY ANALYSIS;DRUG-REACTIONS;etoposide;FAERS;FEBRILE NEUTROPENIA;pharmacovigilance;PHASE-II TRIAL;PRIMARY PROPHYLAXIS;PUBLIC VERSION;real-word analysis;TOPOISOMERASE-II;TUMOR LYSIS SYNDROME,,

Unfortunately, ritonavir, used to boost nirmatrelvir pharmacokinetics, can also inhibit or induce the metabolism of other co-administered drugs substrates. This may lead to a subsequent risk of adverse drug reaction and lack of efficacy. In this study, we aimed at describing the expert advices provided by the biological pharmacology network of the SFPT (i.e., the therapeutic drug monitoring specialists working in the laboratories of the pharmacology departments in France/Belgium). From February to August 2022, we collected all specialized advices provided by the biological pharmacology network of the SFPT. Seven pharmacology departments actively participated in the study (Brussels Saint-Luc Hospital in Belgium, Caen, Dijon, Nantes, Nancy, Rennes and Toulouse in France). We collected the following data: patient's age, date of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir initiation, clinical department requiring the expert advice, patient's treatments, and advice provided. One hundred and six expert advice on 753 drugs were provided during the seven months of data collection. Two centers provided 83% of all the expert advice (around 8/month). Patients originated form a transplantation department in 65% of the cases. The most common request were for cardiac drugs (28%), immunosuppressive drugs (24%) and endocrine drugs (18%). The advice were distributed as follows: treatment continuation, treatment discontinuation during the antiviral course, dosage adjustment, and treatment switch in 59%, 28%, 11%, and 1.6% of the cases, respectively. Only 2 pieces of advice (0.3%) constituted treatment contra-indications. Drug monitoring was proposed in 10% of prescription lines. Expert advice provided by the biological pharmacology network of the SFPT allows securing the combination of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir with other concomitant drugs.

Automated text mining approaches, in particular those aimed at finding relationships between entities, are key for identification of actionable knowledge from free text repositories. We present the BeFree system aimed at identifying relationships between biomedical entities with a special focus on genes and their associated diseases.     Results: By exploiting morpho-syntactic information of the text, BeFree is able to identify gene-disease, drug-disease and drug-target associations with state-of-the-art performance. The application of BeFree to real-case scenarios shows its effectiveness in extracting information relevant for translational research. We show the value of the gene-disease associations extracted by BeFree through a number of analyses and integration with other data sources. BeFree succeeds in identifying genes associated to a major cause of morbidity worldwide, depression, which are not present in other public resources. Moreover, large-scale extraction and analysis of gene-disease associations, and integration with current biomedical knowledge, provided interesting insights on the kind of information that can be found in the literature, and raised challenges regarding data prioritization and curation. We found that only a small proportion of the gene-disease associations discovered by using BeFree is collected in expert-curated databases. Thus, there is a pressing need to find alternative strategies to manual curation, in order to review, prioritize and curate text-mining data and incorporate it into domain-specific databases. We present our strategy for data prioritization and discuss its implications for supporting biomedical research and applications.     Conclusions: BeFree is a novel text mining system that performs competitively for the identification of gene-disease, drug-disease and drug-target associations. Our analyses show that mining only a small fraction of MEDLINE results in a large dataset of gene-disease associations, and only a small proportion of this dataset is actually recorded in curated resources (2%), raising several issues on data prioritization and curation. We propose that joint analysis of text mined data with data curated by experts appears as a suitable approach to both assess data quality and highlight novel and interesting information.","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;168<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;183<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;48</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Dados de bases não oficiais",10.1186/s12859-015-0472-9,ADVERSE DRUG EVENTS;Big data;Biocuration;Corpus development;Disease;Information extraction;INTEGRATE;KERNEL;KNOWLEDGE;LANGUAGE;Machine learning;TARGETS;Text mining;Translational bioinformatics,,

Since other studies such as clinical trial and retrospective study have limitations for detecting the immune-related adverse events (irAEs) characterized by unpredictable onset, nonspecific symptoms and wide clinical spectrum, we aimed to identify the incidence of irAEs and to detect and evaluate the signals using real-world data.Methods Cancer patients treated with anticancer medications were analyzed using the nationwide health insurance claims database of South Korea from 2017 to 2019, and Clinical Data Warehouse (CDW) database of Asan Medical Center (AMC), a tertiary referral hospital, from 2012 to 2019. AEs of ICI users were compared with those of non-ICI anticancer medication users. PD-1 inhibitors (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and PD-L1 inhibitors (atezolizumab) were evaluated. We defined an AE as a newly added diagnosis after the ICI prescription using an ICD-10 diagnostic code. A signal was defined as an AE that was detected by any one of the four indices of data mining: hazard ratio (HR), proportional claims ratio (PCR), claims odds ratio (COR), or information component (IC). All detected signals were reviewed and classified into well-known or potential irAEs. Signal verification was performed for targeted AEs using CDW of AMC using diagnostic codes and text mining.Results We identified 118 significant signals related to ICI use. We detected 31 well-known irAEs, most of which were endocrine diseases and skin diseases. We also detected 33 potential irAEs related to disorders in the nervous system, eye, circulatory system, digestive system, skin and subcutaneous tissues, and bones. Especially, portal vein thrombosis and bone disorders such as osteoporosis with pathological fracture and fracture of shoulder, upper arm, femur, and lower leg showed high HR in ICI users than in non-ICI users. The signals from hospital database were verified using diagnostic codes and text mining.Conclusion This real-world data analysis demonstrated an efficient approach for signal detection and evaluation of ICI use. An effective real-world pharmacovigilance system of the nationwide claims database and the EMR could complement each other in detecting significant AE signals.","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;56</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Dados de bases não oficiais",10.3389/fonc.2023.1295923,data mining;drug safety surveillance;immune checkpoint inhibitor;immune-related adverse event;pharmacovigilance;SURVIVAL;THYROIDITIS,,

The objective of this study was to develop and validate a text-mining tool to identify naloxone administrations in EHR data. Methods: Clinical notes stored in databases between January 2017 and March 2018 were used to iteratively develop a text-mining tool to identify naloxone administrations. The first iteration of the tool used broad search terms. Then, after reviewing clinical notes of overdose encounters, we developed a list of phrases that described naloxone administrations to inform iteration two. While validating iteration two, additional phrases were found, which were then added to inform the final iteration. The comparator was an administrative code query extracted from the EHR. Medical record review was used to identify true positives. The primary outcome was the positive predictive values (PPV) of the second iteration, final iteration, and administrative code query. Results: Iteration two, the final iteration, and the administrative code had PPVs of 84.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 78.6-89.0%), 83.8% (95% CI 78.6-88.2%), and 57.1% (95% CI 47.1-66.8%), respectively. Both iterations of the tool had a significantly higher PPV than the administrative code (p < 0.001). Conclusions: A text-mining tool improved the identification of naloxone administrations in EHR data from less than 60% with the administrative code to greater than 80% with both versions of the tool. Text-mining tools can inform the use of more sophisticated informatics methods, which often require significant time, resource, and expertise investment.","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;24</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza DM,Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Dados de bases não oficiais",10.1080/08897077.2020.1856288,clinical notes;electronic health record;Naloxone;OVERDOSE;PHARMACOVIGILANCE;positive predictive value;text mining,,

Vast majority of medical errors are related to adverse drug reactions, while drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are the main cause of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). DDIs and ADRs have mainly been reported by haphazard case studies. Experimental in vivo and in vitro researches also reveals DDI pairs. Laboratory and experimental researches are valuable but also expensive and in some cases researchers may suffer from limitations.     Methods: In the current investigation, the latest published works were studied to analyze the trend and pattern of the DDI modelling and the impacts of machine learning methods. Applications of computerized techniques were also investigated for the prediction and interpretation of DDIs.     Results: Computerized data-mining in pharmaceutical sciences and related databases provide new key transformative paradigms that can revolutionize the treatment of diseases and hence medical care. Given that various aspects of drug discovery and pharmacotherapy are closely related to the clinical and molecular/biological information, the scientifically sound databases (e.g., DDIs, ADRs) can be of importance for the success of pharmacotherapy modalities.     Conclusion: A better understanding of DDIs not only provides a robust means for designing more effective medicines but also grantees patient safety.","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;29<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;29<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;47</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Revisão",10.15171/bi.2016.10,BIOLOGY;Data mining;DISCOVERY;Drug-drug interaction;INTERACTION ALERTS;Machin learning;MICROARRAY;NETWORKS;Pharmacodinamics;Pharmacokinetics;TECHNOLOGY;Text minimg;TOXICOGENOMICS;VIEWS,,

Under the tested method, prior distribution of ADE probability of a less frequent drug could be derived from frequent drugs with a high biochemical similarity, and posterior probability of null hypothesis could be used for signal detection and false-positive control. We evaluated the tested and reference methods by mining relatively newer drugs in real-world data (e.g., the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) data) and conducting a simulation study.ResultsIn FAERS analysis, the times to achieve a same probability of detection for drug-labeled ADEs following initial drug reporting were 5 years and >= 7 years for the tested method and reference methods, respectively. Additionally, the tested method compared with reference methods had higher AUC values (0.57-0.79 vs. 0.32-0.71), especially within 3 years following initial drug reporting.

These missing or incomplete features can affect and limit the application of quantitative methods in pharmacovigilance for meta-analyses of data during randomized clinical trials. Methods: Data from patients with hypertension were retrieved and integrated from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System; 134 antihypertensive drugs out of 1131 drugs were filtered and then evaluated using the empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM) of the posterior distribution to build ADE-drug profiles with an emphasis on the pulmonary ADEs. Afterward, the graphical least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (GLASSO) captured drug associations based on pulmonary ADEs by correcting hidden factors and confounder misclassification. Selected drugs were then compared using the Friedman test in drug classes and clusters obtained from GLASSO. Results: Following multiple filtering stages to exclude insignificant and noise-driven reports, we found that drugs from antihypertensives agents, urologicals, and antithrombotic agents (macitentan, bosentan, epoprostenol, selexipag, sildenafil, tadalafil, and beraprost) form a similar class with a significantly higher incidence of pulmonary ADEs. Macitentan and bosentan were associated with 64% and 56% of pulmonary ADEs, respectively. Because these two medications are prescribed in diseases affecting pulmonary function and may be likely to emerge among the highest reported pulmonary ADEs, in fact, they serve to validate the methods utilized here. Conversely, doxazosin and rilmenidine were found to have the least pulmonary ADEs in selected drugs from hypertension patients. Nifedipine and candesartan were also found by signal detection methods to form a drug cluster, shown by several studies an effective combination of these drugs on lowering blood pressure and appeared an improved side effect profile in comparison with single-agent monotherapy. Conclusions: We consider pulmonary ADE profiles in multiple long-standing groups of therapeutics including antihypertensive agents, antithrombotic agents, beta-blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, or agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, in patients with hypertension associated with high risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We found that several individual drugs have significant differences between their drug classes and compared to other drug classes. For instance, macitentan and bosentan from endothelin receptor antagonists show major concern while doxazosin and rilmenidine exhibited the least pulmonary ADEs compared to the outcomes of other drugs. Using techniques in this study, we assessed and confirmed the hypothesis that drugs from the same drug class could have very different pulmonary ADE profiles affecting outcomes in acute respiratory illness.

As such, the current study is to assess disproportionate reporting of primary malignant lung cancer among reports for ACEIs submitted to the FDA adverse event reporting system utilizing a pharmacovigilance approach. We conducted a disproportionality analysis of primary malignant lung cancer adverse events associated with 10 ACEIs by calculating the reported odds ratios (ROR) and information component (IC) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). ROR was adjusted for sex, age, and reporting year by logistic regression analyses. From January 2004 to March 2020, a total of 622 cases of lung cancer adverse event reports were identified for ACEIs users. Significant disproportionate association was found for ACEIs as a drug class (ROR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.13-1.32; IC: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.17-0.39. adjusted ROR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.02-1.49). After stratification based on gender, a subset analysis suggested that female patients exhibited a significant disproportionate association, while male patients did not. Sensitivity analyses that limited the data by reporting region, comorbidity, and reporting year also showed similar trends. Statistical significant lung cancer signals were detected among patients who received ACEI, especially female patients.

The EMA has specified a list of adverse events of interest to be monitored. The EMA sets out 3 different ways to conduct such surveillance: (1) active surveillance, (2) enhanced passive surveillance, or (3) electronic health record data mining (EHR-DM). English general practice (GP) is a suitable setting to implement enhanced passive surveillance and EHR-DM.     Objective: This study aimed to test the feasibility of conducting enhanced passive surveillance in GP using the yellow card scheme (adverse events of interest reporting cards) to determine if it has any advantages over EHR-DM alone.     Methods: A total of 9 GPs in England participated, of which 3 tested the feasibility of enhanced passive surveillance and the other 6 EHR-DM alone. The 3 that tested EPS provided patients with yellow (adverse events) cards for patients to report any adverse events. Data were extracted from all 9 GPs'EHRs between weeks 35 and 49 (08/24/2015 to 12/06/2015), the main period of influenza vaccination. We conducted weekly analysis and end-of-study analyses.     Results: Our GPs were largely distributed across England with a registered population of 81,040. In the week 49 report, 15,863/81,040 people (19.57% of the registered practice population) were vaccinated. In the EPS practices, staff managed to hand out the cards to 61.25% (4150/6776) of the vaccinees, and of these cards, 1.98% (82/4150) were returned to the GP offices. Adverse events of interests were reported by 113/7223 people (1.56%) in the enhanced passive surveillance practices, compared with 322/8640 people (3.73%) in the EHR-DM practices.     Conclusions: Overall, we demonstrated that GPs EHR-DM was an appropriate method of enhanced surveillance. However, the use of yellow cards, in enhanced passive surveillance practices, did not enhance the collection of adverse events of interests as demonstrated in this study. Their return rate was poor, data entry from them was not straightforward, and there were issues with data reconciliation. We concluded that customized cards prespecifying the EMA's adverse events of interests, combined with EHR-DM, were needed to maximize data collection.","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;18</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Usa dados de Vacinas | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Vacinas",10.2196/12016,computerized;drug-related side effects and adverse reactions;England;general practice;human;influenza;influenza vaccines;medical records systems;safety management;vaccines,,

However, comprehensive evaluation of its long-term safety profile in a large sample population remains elusive. The current study assessed Tivozanib-related adverse events of real-world through data mining of the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System FDA Adverse Event Reporting System.Methods Disproportionality analyses, utilizing reporting odds ratio proportional reporting ratio Bayesian confidence propagation neural network and multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS) algorithms, were conducted to quantify signals of Tivozanib-related AEs. Weibull distribution was used to predict the varying risk incidence of AEs over time.Results Out of 5,361,420 reports collected from the FAERS database, 1,366 reports of Tivozanib-associated AEs were identified. A total of 94 significant disproportionality preferred terms (PTs) conforming to the four algorithms simultaneously were retained. The most common AEs included fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, blood pressure increased, decreased appetite, and dysphonia, consistent with prior specifications and clinical trials. Unexpected significant AEs such as dyspnea, constipation, pain in extremity, stomatitis, and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome was observed. The median onset time of Tivozanib-related AEs was 37 days (interquartile range [IQR] 11.75-91 days), with a majority (n = 127, 46.35%) occurring within the initial month following Tivozanib initiation.Conclusion Our observations align with clinical assertions regarding Tivozanib's safety profile. Additionally, we unveil potential novel and unexpected AE signatures associated with Tivozanib administration, highlighting the imperative for prospective clinical studies to validate these findings and elucidate their causal relationships.

In the health context, adverse drug events account for countless hospitalizations and deaths annually. Since users often begin their information seeking and reporting with online searches, examination of search query logs has emerged as an important detection channel. However, search context - including query intent and heterogeneity in user behaviors - is extremely important for extracting information from search queries, and yet the challenge of measuring and analyzing these aspects has precluded their use in prior studies. We propose DeepSAVE, a novel deep learning framework for detecting adverse events based on user search query logs. DeepSAVE uses an enriched variational autoencoder encompassing a novel query embedding and user modeling module that work in concert to address the context challenge associated with search-based detection of adverse events. Evaluation results on three large real-world event datasets show that DeepSAVE outperforms existing detection methods as well as comparison deep learning auto encoders. Ablation analysis reveals that each component of DeepSAVE significantly contributes to its overall performance.

This paper reports the first development of a visual analytics (VA) system that examines how different medications associate with AKI. In this paper, we introduce and describe VISA_M3R3, a VA system designed to assist healthcare researchers in identifying medications and medication combinations that associate with a higher risk of AKI using electronic medical records (EMRs). By integrating multiple regression models, frequent itemset mining, data visualization, and human-data interaction mechanisms, VISA_M3R3 allows users to explore complex relationships between medications and AKI in such a way that would be difficult or sometimes even impossible without the help of a VA system. Through an analysis of 595 medications using VISA_M3R3, we have identified 55 AKI-inducing medications, 24,212 frequent medication groups, and 78 medication groups that are associated with AKI. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the usefulness of VISA_M3R3 in the investigation of medication-induced AKI in particular and other clinical problems in general.

PICS is a computational method capable of expeditiously elucidating both known and novel biological pathway involvement specific to various cancers and uses that learned pathway information to separate patients into distinct classes. The method clearly separates a pan-cancer dataset by tissue of origin and also sub-classifies individual cancer datasets into distinct survival classes. Gene expression values are collapsed into pathway scores that reveal which biological activities are most useful for clustering cancer cohorts into subtypes. Variants of the method allow it to be used on datasets that do and do not contain non-cancerous samples. Activity levels of all types of pathways, broadly grouped into metabolic, cellular processes and signaling, and immune system, are useful for separating the pan-cancer cohort. In the clustering of specific cancer types, certain pathway types become more valuable depending on the site being studied. For lung cancer, signaling pathways dominate; for pancreatic cancer, signaling and metabolic pathways dominate; and for melanoma, immune system pathways are the most useful. This work suggests the utility of pathway-level genomic analysis and points in the direction of using pathway classification for predicting the efficacy and side effects of drugs and radiation.","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;12<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;14<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;31</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Dados de bases não oficiais",10.4137/CIN.S40088,biological pathways;data-mining;genomics-based optimization;oncogenomics;RECONSTRUCTION;SIGNATURE;STAGE;SURVIVAL;systems biology,,

In this work, a novel technique to DDI prediction using knowledge graph-based approach called KGAT is proposed, which utilizes attention mechanisms with graph convolution layers to capture important features and correlations between drugs and other entities such as targets and genes. Our model employs attention mechanisms to prioritize significant interactions and aggregates information through sum, mean, and max operations to enhance prediction accuracy. This allows KGAT to effectively mine high-order structures and semantic relationships within the knowledge graph. We evaluate our model on the KEGG dataset and compare its performance with existing state-of-the-art methods. The results show that KGAT outperforms these methods. Additionally, our approach has several advantages, including simplicity, interpretability, and low-dimensional complexity, making it a promising tool for accelerating drug discovery and development. By identifying novel drug combinations with improved efficacy and safety profiles, our approach has the potential to improve patient outcomes and support safer drug development. Our study highlights the potential of attention mechanisms in knowledge graph-based drug combination prediction, and we believe that KGAT can serve as a valuable framework for future research in this field.","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;58</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Dados de bases não oficiais",10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3483993,Accuracy;Artificial intelligence;attention mechanisms;Attention mechanisms;Biological system modeling;Biomedical monitoring;Computational modeling;Data mining;Data models;drug-drug interactions;Drugs;graph neural networks;knowledge graph;Knowledge graphs;Predictive models;Soft sensors,,

Material and methods     We used data from de-identified EHRs of three mental health trusts in the UK (>50 million documents, over 500,000 patients, 2835 of which were prescribed Clozapine). We explored the prevalence of 33 adverse effects by age, gender, ethnicity, smoking status and admission type three months before and after the patients started Clozapine treatment.

Several studies have shown that nonadherence is weakly associated with personal and clinical variables but strongly associated with patients' beliefs and attitudes toward medications. Patients' drug review posts in online health care communities might provide a significant insight into patients' attitude toward antidepressants and could be used to address the challenges of self-report methods such as patients' recruitment.     Objective: The aim of this study was to use patient-generated data to identify factors affecting the patient's attitude toward 4 antidepressants drugs (sertraline [Zoloft], escitalopram [Lexapro], duloxetine [Cymbalta], and venlafaxine [Effexor XR]), which in turn, is a strong determinant of treatment nonadherence. We hypothesized that clinical variables (drug effectiveness; adverse drug reactions, ADRs; perceived distress from ADRs, ADR-PD; and duration of treatment) and personal variables (age, gender, and patients' knowledge about medications) are associated with patients' attitude toward antidepressants, and experience of ADRs and drug ineffectiveness are strongly associated with negative attitude.     Methods: We used both qualitative and quantitative methods to analyze the dataset. Patients' drug reviews were randomly selected from a health care forum called askapatient. The Framework method was used to build the analytical framework containing the themes for developing structured data from the qualitative drug reviews. Then, 4 annotators coded the drug reviews at the sentence level using the analytical framework. After managing missing values, we used chi-square and ordinal logistic regression to test and model the association between variables and attitude.     Results: A total of 892 reviews posted between February 2001 and September 2016 were analyzed. Most of the patients were females (680/892, 76.2%) and aged less than 40 years (540/892, 60.5%). Patient attitude was significantly (P<.001) associated with experience of ADRs, ADR-PD, drug effectiveness, perceived lack of knowledge, experience of withdrawal, and duration of usage, whereas oth age (F-4,F-874 =0.72, P=.58) and gender (chi(2)(4) =2.7, P=.21) were not found to be associated with patient attitudes. Moreover, modeling the relationship between variables and attitudes showed that drug effectiveness and perceived distress from adverse drug reactions were the 2 most significant factors affecting patients' attitude toward antidepressants.     Conclusions: Patients' self-report experiences of medications in online health care communities can provide a direct insight into the underlying factors associated with patients' perceptions and attitudes toward antidepressants. However, it cannot be used as a replacement for self-report methods because of the lack of information for some of the variables, colloquial language, and the unstructured format of the reports.","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;32</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Dados de bases não oficiais",10.2196/10726,ADHERENCE;antidepressive agents;ANXIETY;attitude;BELIEFS;CARE;chronic disease;community networks;data mining;depression;DEPRESSION;DISORDERS;framework method;HISTORY;internet;MEDICATION;medication adherence;NONADHERENCE;patient-centered care;perception;RISK;social media,,

Relation extraction is one such task where semantic relations between the entities are identified from the free text. In the biomedical domain, extraction of regulatory pathways, metabolic processes, adverse drug reaction or disease models necessitates knowledge from the individual relations, for example, physical or regulatory interactions between genes, proteins, drugs, chemical, disease or phenotype. Results: In this paper, we study the relation extraction task from three major biomedical and clinical tasks, namely drug-drug interaction, protein-protein interaction, and medical concept relation extraction. Towards this, we model the relation extraction problem in a multi-task learning (MTL)framework, and introduce for the first time the concept of structured self-attentive network complemented with the adversarial learning approach for the prediction of relationships from the biomedical and clinical text. The fundamental notion of MTL is to simultaneously learn multiple problems together by utilizing the concepts of the shared representation. Additionally, we also generate the highly efficient single task model which exploits the shortest dependency path embedding learned over the attentive gated recurrent unit to compare our proposed MTL models.

However, identifying clinically-relevant content in social media without manual labeling is a challenge because of the sheer volume of irrelevant data. We present an unsupervised, iterative approach to mine clinically relevant information from social media data, which begins by heuristically filtering for HCP-authored texts and incorporates topic modeling and concept extraction with MetaMap. This approach identifies granular topics and tweets with high clinical relevance from a set of about 52 million COVID-19-related tweets from January to mid-June 2020. We also show that because the technique does not require manual labeling, it can be used to identify emerging topics on a week-to-week basis.

Disproportionality analysis, employing robust algorithms including ROR, PRR, BCPNN, and EBGM was employed for effective data mining to quantify signals associated with lenvatinib-related AEs. Results: Among the collected reports, a total of 15,193 cases were identified where lenvatinib was the ""primary suspected (PS)"" drug, resulting in 50,508 lenvatinib-induced AEs. An analysis was conducted to examine the occurrence of lenvatinib-induced adverse drug reactions (ADRs) across 26 organ systems. The findings revealed the presence of expected ADRs, including diarrhea, vomiting, stomatitis, hepatic encephalopathy, decreased appetite, dehydration, decreased weight, and electrolyte imbalances, which were consistent with the information provided in the drug labels. Furthermore, unexpected significant ADRs were observed at the preferred terms (PT) level, such as interstitial lung disease, pneumothorax, hypophysitis, failure to thrive, polycythemia, hypopituitarism, spontaneous pneumothorax, pulmonary cavitation, and limbic encephalitis. These findings indicated the potential occurrence of adverse effects that are currently not documented in the drug instructions. Conclusions: This study has successfully detected novel and unforeseen signals pertaining to ADRs associated with the administration of lenvatinib, thereby contributing significant insights into the intricate correlation between ADRs and the utilization of lenvatinib. The outcomes of this investigation underscore the utmost significance of continuous monitoring and vigilant surveillance in order to promptly identify and effectively manage AEs, consequently enhancing overall patient safety and well-being in the context of lenvatinib therapy.","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;27</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e28132,BCPNN;CARCINOMA;EBGM;lenvatinib;MANAGEMENT;PATIENT;PRR;ROR,,

These data are often used for drug utilisation studies to identify inappropriate medicine use at the population level that may be associated with known safety issues. Lack of coded diagnoses, to identify outcomes, and lack of data on confounders can limit use of these data in practice for medication safety assessment. To overcome these issues, studies have exploited the fact that symptoms of adverse effects of medications can be treated with other medications, for example antidepressants to treat depression or oxybutynin to treat urinary incontinence. The challenge of unmeasured confounding has been addressed by implementing self-controlled study designs that use within-person comparisons and provide inherent control for confounding. Prescription sequence symmetry analysis (SSA) is a within-person study design that has been demonstrated as a useful tool for safety signal generation in dispensing data.SummaryUsing medicine initiation as a proxy for the development of adverse events can help to generate evidence of the safety of medicines when only medication dispensing data are available. Careful consideration, however, should be given to the sensitivity and specificity of the proxy medicine for the adverse event and potential for time-varying confounding due to trends in medicine utilisation. Data-mining approaches using dispensing data have the potential to improve safety assessments; however, the challenge of unmeasured confounding with these methods remains to be investigated.","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;13<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;15<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;80</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - REVISÃO | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Revisão",10.1007/s40471-018-0176-6,ADVERSE DRUG-REACTIONS;ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS;CASE-SERIES ANALYSIS;Dispensing data;HEART-FAILURE;INHALED CORTICOSTEROIDS;Medication proxy;Medication safety;NONSTEROIDAL ANTIINFLAMMATORY DRUGS;PRESCRIPTION DATABASES;Self-controlled designs;SEQUENCE SYMMETRY ANALYSIS;SIGNAL-DETECTION;SPONTANEOUS REPORTING DATABASE,,

Adverse drug events (ADEs) were classified and described according to the preferred terms and system organ classes in the Medical Dictionary of Regulatory Activity. Proportional reporting ratio (PRR), reporting odds ratio (ROR) and Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) were used to detect signals.Results: The number of ADE reports with ticagrelor as the primary suspect drug was 12,909. The top three ADEs were dyspnea [1824 reports, ROR 7.34, PRR 6.45, information component (IC) 2.68], chest pain (458 reports, ROR 5.43, PRR 5.27, IC 2.39), and vascular stent thrombosis (406 reports, ROR 409.53, PRR 396.68, IC 8.02). The highest ROR, 630.24, was found for ""vascular stent occlusion"".

A pharmacovigilance study,2022,11,9,FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY,1663-9812,13,,,"Xia, S and Zhao, YC and Guo, L and Gong, H and Wang, YK and Ma, R and Zhang, BK and Sheng, Y and Sarangdhar, M and Noguchi, Y and Yan, M",,English,,,"Introduction: Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) produce unparalleled efficacy in refractory neoplasms but can also lead to serious toxicities. Although ADC-related sepsis has been reported, the clinical features are not well characterized in real-world studies.     Objective: The aim of this study was to identify the association between ADCs and sepsis using FAERS data and uncover the clinical characteristics of ADC-related sepsis.     Methods: We performed disproportionality analysis using FAERS data and compared rates of sepsis in cancer patients receiving ADCs vs. other regimens. Associations between ADCs and sepsis were assessed using reporting odds ratios (RORs) and information component (IC). For each treatment group, we detected drug interaction signals, and conducted subgroup analyses (age, gender, and regimens) and sensitivity analyses.     Results: A total of 24,618 cases were reported with ADCs between Q1, 2004 and Q3, 2021. Sepsis, septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and other sepsis-related toxicities were significantly associated with ADCs than other drugs in this database. Sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome have the highest safety concerns with ADCs compared with other anticancer monotherapies. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin and inotuzumab ozogamicin showed increased safety risks than other ADCs. For the top nine ADC-related sepsis, males showed higher sepsis safety concern than females (p <0.001); however, age did not exert influence on the risk of sepsis. We identified that 973 of 2,441 (39.9%) cases had acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 766 of 2613 (29.3%) cases on ADCs died during therapy. Time-to-onset analysis indicated ADC-related sepsis is prone to occur within a month after administration. Co-administration of ADCs with colony-stimulating factors, proton pump inhibitors, H2-receptor antagonists, or CYP3A4/5 inhibitors showed to synergistically increase the risk of sepsis-related toxicities.     Conclusion: Antibody-drug conjugates may increase the risk of sepsis in cancer patients, leading to high mortality. Further studies are warranted to characterize the underlying mechanisms and design preventive measures for ADC-related sepsis.","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;12<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;12<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;44</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.3389/fphar.2022.967017,antibody-drug conjugates;data mining;FAERS;INHIBITORS;OUTCOMES;pharmacovigilance;sepsis;TIME,,

However, concerns about rare and fatal adverse events, including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) have arisen. The aim of this study was to excavate and evaluate the risk of PARP inhibitors causing MDS and AML based on real-world data from two international pharmacovigilance databases.Methods: We analyzed adverse event (AE) reports of four PARP inhibitors (olaparib, niraparib, rucaparib and talazoparib) associated with MDS and AML from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and EudraVigilance (EV) databases between 1 October 2014, and 30 September 2021, including demographic characteristics, fatality and times to onset. Three different data mining algorithms were used to detect the signals of PARP inhibitors associated with MDS and AML.Results: In total, 16,710 and 11,937 PARP inhibitor AE reports were found in the FAERS and EV databases, of which 332 and 349 were associated with MDS and AML, respectively. The median latencies of MDS and AML associated with PARP inhibitors were 211 [interquartile range (IQR) 93.5-491.25] days and 355 (IQR 72.00-483.50) days, respectively. The average fatality rates of MDS and AML caused by the four PARP inhibitors were 37.96 and 60.41%, respectively, in the FAERS database, while those in the EV database were 5.83 and 12.16%, respectively. Based on the criteria used for the three algorithms, a significant disproportionate association was found between PARP inhibitors as a drug class and MDS/AML. Notably, the risk of MDS was much higher than that of AML. Olaparib appeared to have a stronger association with MDS and AML than did other PARP inhibitors.Conclusion: In the real world, PARP inhibitors increase the risk of MDS and AML, which can result in high mortality and tend to occur during long-term use. Our findings provide objective evidence for the postmarketing safety of PARP inhibitors.","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;21<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;21<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;37</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza DM,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.3389/fphar.2022.912256,acute myeloid leukemia;DISEASE;DOUBLE-BLIND;MAINTENANCE THERAPY;METAANALYSIS;myelodysplastic syndrome;OLAPARIB;OVARIAN-CANCER;PARP inhibitors;pharmacovigilance;real-world,,

Nevertheless, safety issues may still arise. Using the simulation described in this manuscript, our aim is to develop adequate detection methods for manufacturing-related safety signals, especially in the context of biological products.     Methods: Pharmaceutical companies record the entire batch genealogies, from seed batches over intermediates to final product (FP) batches. We constructed a hierarchical tree based on this genealogy information and linked it to the spontaneous safety data available for the FP batch numbers. The tree-based scan statistic (TBSS) was used on simulated data as a proof of concept to locate the source that may have subsequently generated an excess of specific adverse events (AEs) within the manufacturing steps, and to evaluate the method's adjustment for multiple testing. All calculations were performed with a customized program in SAS v9.2.     Results: The TBSS generated a close to expected number of false positive signals, demonstrating that it adjusted for multiple testing. Overall, the method detected 71% of the simulated signals at the correct production step when a 6-fold increase in reports with AEs of interest (AEOI) was applied, and 31% when a 2-fold increase was applied. The relatively low detection performance may be attributed to the higher granularity associated with the lower levels of the hierarchy, leading to a lack of power and the stringent definition criteria that were applied for a true positive result.     Conclusion: As a data-mining method for manufacturing-related safety signal detection, the TBSS may provide advantages over other disproportionality analyses (using batch information) but may benefit from complementary methods (not relaying on batch information). While the method warrants further refinement, it may improve safety signal detection and contribute to improvements in the quality of manufacturing processes. (C) 2018 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA.

They carry labels as anxiolytics, hypnotics or antiepileptics. All benzodiazepines and several nonbenzodiazepine Z-drugs share high affinity binding sites on certain subtypes of GABAA receptors, from which they can be displaced by the clinically used antagonist flumazenil. Additional binding sites exist and overlap in part with sites used by some general anaesthetics and barbiturates. Despite substantial preclinical efforts, it remains unclear which receptor subtypes and ligand features mediate individual drug effects. There is a paucity of literature comparing clinically observed adverse effect liabilities across substances in methodologically coherent ways. MethodsIn order to examine heterogeneity in clinical outcome, we screened the publicly available U.S. FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS) database for reports of individual compounds and analyzed them for each sex individually with the use of disproportionality analysis. The complementary use of physico-chemical descriptors provides a molecular basis for the analysis of clinical observations of wanted and unwanted drug effects. Results and DiscussionWe found a multifaceted FAERS picture, and suggest that more thorough clinical and pharmacoepidemiologic investigations of the heterogenous side effect profiles for benzodiazepines and Z-drugs are needed. This may lead to more differentiated safety profiles and prescription practice for particular compounds, which in turn could potentially ease side effect burden in everyday clinical practice considerably. From both preclinical literature and pharmacovigilance data, there is converging evidence that this very large class of psychoactive molecules displays a broad range of distinctive unwanted effect profiles - too broad to be explained by the four canonical, so-called ""diazepam-sensitive high-affinity interaction sites"". The substance-specific signatures of compound effects may partly be mediated by phenomena such as occupancy of additional binding sites, and/or synergistic interactions with endogenous substances like steroids and endocannabinoids. These in turn drive the wanted and unwanted effects and sex differences of individual compounds.","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;154</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Included"", ""Carolina""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Incluído,Mineração de dados em base governamental de farmacovigilância",10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1188101,A RECEPTOR;adverse events;benzodiazepine;benzodiazepine binding sites;DATA MINING APPROACH;DELTA-SUBUNIT;DISPROPORTIONALITY ANALYSIS;FDA adverse event reporting system;GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID;NONMEDICAL USE;ORAL-CONTRACEPTIVES;pharmacovigilance;PRESYNAPTIC GABA(A) RECEPTORS;sex differences;side effects;SIGNAL-DETECTION;TRIPLICATE PRESCRIPTION;Z-drugs,,

The AE of GIP induced by novel antineoplastic agents has attracted attention recently. We aimed to explore the AE signals of GIP related to novel antineoplastic agents comprehensively based on the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).Methods: The FAERS database containing 71 quarters of records was used for analysis. Reporting odds ratio (ROR), information component (IC), and empirical Bayesian geometric mean (EBGM) were utilized to evaluate the signals of GIP associated with novel antineoplastic drugs. Standardization of drug names was by employing MedEx-UIMA software and Python. Data analysis and visualization were performed using MySQL Workbench and R software.Results: After cleaning and handling the data, 5226 GIP cases were identified that were associated with new antineoplastic medications, where these agents were the main suspected contributors. A total of 37 novel antineoplastic drugs were detected with signals of GIP for ROR and IC. Only 22 drugs showed statistically significant signals for EBGM. We found the GIP signals of 22 novel antineoplastic drugs overlapped for the 3 indicators, including anti-vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, anti-endothelial growth factor receptor, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and so on.Conclusion: The potential risk of GIP associated with several novel antineoplastic agents was identified through data mining, which provided valuable information on the safety risks associated with GIP among these drugs.

Ripretinib, the first tyrosine kinase switch control inhibitor, has not yet been extensively studied for long-term safety in large populations. This study evaluates Ripretinib-related adverse events (AEs) in real-world applications by analyzing data from the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).Methods To quantify signals of AEs, we employed several disproportionality analyses: the Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), and Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS).Results In the FAERS database, out of 7,064,646 reports, 3,161 were identified as related to Ripretinib AEs, with 438 significant disproportionality in preferred terms. The most common adverse reactions were tiredness, hair loss, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, loss of appetite, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, and vomiting. These reactions align with the medication instructions and reports from corresponding clinical trials. Notably, the label includes unexpected and significant AEs such as ""hepatic neoplasm"", ""hair texture abnormal"", ""metastases to liver"" and ""red blood cell count decreased"". The median onset time for Ripretinib-related AEs was 99 days, with an interquartile range of 27-245 days. Most cases (26.74%, n = 165) occurred within the first month of Ripretinib administration.Conclusion Our findings align with clinical observations. We identified novel and unexpected AEs signatures of Ripretinib, indicating that prospective clinical studies are necessary to confirm these findings and clarify their implications.

Historically, serendipity has contributed significantly to identifying many new drug indications. If patient-reported serendipitous drug usage in social media could be computationally identified, it could help generate and validate drug-repositioning hypotheses. We investigated deep neural network models for mining serendipitous drug usage from social media. We used the word2vec algorithm to construct word-embedding features from drug reviews posted in a WebMD patient forum. We adapted and redesigned the convolutional neural network, long short-term memory network, and convolutional long short-term memory network by adding contextual information extracted from drug-review posts, information-filtering tools, medical ontology, and medical knowledge. We trained, tuned, and evaluated our models with a gold-standard dataset of 15 714 sentences (447 [2.8%] describing serendipitous drug usage). Additionally, we compared our deep neural networks to support vector machine, random forest, and AdaBoost. M1 algorithms. Context information helped to reduce the false-positive rate of deep neural network models. If we used an extremely imbalanced dataset with limited instances of serendipitous drug usage, deep neural network models did not outperform other machine-learning models with n-gram and context features. However, deep neural network models could more effectively use word embedding in feature construction, an advantage that makes them worthy of further investigation. Finally, we implemented natural-language processing and machine-learning methods in a web-based application to help scientists and software developers mine social media for serendipitous drug usage.","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;14<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;15<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;62</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza DM,Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Dados de bases não oficiais",10.1109/TNB.2019.2909094,data mining;drug discovery;drug repurposing;ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS;health informatics;IDENTIFICATION;PHARMACOVIGILANCE;Social media,,

The current study was to assess olaparib-related adverse events (AEs) of real-world through data mining of the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Methods: Disproportionality analyses, including the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) and the multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS) algorithms were employed to quantify the signals of olaparib-associated AEs. Results: Out of 8,450,009 reports collected from the FAERS database, 6402 reports of olaparib-associated AEs were identified. A total of 118 significant disproportionality preferred terms (PTs) conforming to the four algorithms simultaneously were retained. The most common AEs included anemia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, decreased appetite, blood creatinine increased and dermatomyositis, which were corresponding to those reported in the specification and clinical trials. Unexpected significant AEs as interstitial lung disease, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, folate deficiency, renal impairment and intestinal obstruction might also occur. The median onset time of olaparib-related AEs was 61 days (interquartile range [IQR] 14–182 days), and most of the cases occurred within the first 1 month after olaparib initiation. Conclusion: Results of our study were consistent with clinical observations, and we also found potential new and unexpected AEs signals for olaparib, suggesting prospective clinical studies were needed to confirm these results and illustrate their relationship. Our results could provide valuable evidence for further safety studies of olaparib.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 96; Correspondence Address: Q.

To solve the problems of unbalance dataset and lack of accurate manual annotations in DDIE, a cross-attention guided Siamese quantum BiGRU (CA-SQBG) is constructed to improve feature representation learning ability for DDIE. It mainly consists of two quantum BiGRUs (QBiGRUs) and a cross-attention, where two QBiGRUs are Siamese implemented in a variational quantum environment to learn the contextual semantic feature representation of drug pairs, cross-attention is employed to learn mutual information from the Siamese QBiGRUs, which in turn allows the two modules to extract DDI more collaboratively. Unlike BiGRU, Siamese QBiGRUs uses internal and external dependencies in quaternion algebra to map DDI correlations within and between multidimensional features, whereas BiGRU can only capture dependencies within sequences. CA-SQBG is evaluated on the DDIExtraction2013 dataset, and the results demonstrate that it can effectively capture the inter- and intra-dependencies within multimodal features with few parameters, using a small number of training samples, and is superior to the most advanced DDIE methods. CA-SQBG offers potential applications for quantum computing and Siamese networks in the field of DDIE.

Methods: We developed a soft prompt-based learning architecture and compared 4 strategies including (1) fine-tuning without prompts; (2) hard-prompting with unfrozen LLMs; (3) soft-prompting with unfrozen LLMs; and (4) soft-prompting with frozen LLMs. We evaluated GatorTron, a clinical LLM with up to 8.9 billion parameters, and compared GatorTron with 4 existing transformer models for clinical concept and relation extraction on 2 benchmark datasets for adverse drug events and social determinants of health (SDoH). We evaluated the few-shot learning ability and generalizability for cross-institution applications. Results and Conclusion: When LLMs are unfrozen, GatorTron-3.9B with soft prompting achieves the best strict F1-scores of 0.9118 and 0.8604 for concept extraction, outperforming the traditional fine-tuning and hard prompt-based models by 0.6 ∼ 3.1 % and 1.2 ∼ 2.9 %, respectively; GatorTron-345 M with soft prompting achieves the best F1-scores of 0.8332 and 0.7488 for end-to-end relation extraction, outperforming other two models by 0.2 ∼ 2 % and 0.6 ∼ 11.7 %, respectively. When LLMs are frozen, small LLMs have a big gap to be competitive with unfrozen models; scaling LLMs up to billions of parameters makes frozen LLMs competitive with unfrozen models. Soft prompting with a frozen GatorTron-8.9B model achieved the best performance for cross-institution evaluation. We demonstrate that (1) machines can learn soft prompts better than hard prompts composed by human, (2) frozen LLMs have good few-shot learning ability and generalizability for cross-institution applications, (3) frozen LLMs reduce computing cost to 2.5 ∼ 6 % of previous methods using unfrozen LLMs, and (4) frozen LLMs require large models (e.g., over several billions of parameters) for good performance. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 23; Correspondence Address: Y.

Over the years, many datasets have been created, and shared tasks have been organised to facilitate active adverse event surveillance. However, most – if not all – datasets or shared tasks focus on extracting ADEs from a particular type of text. Domain generalisation – the ability of a machine learning model to perform well on new, unseen domains (text types) – is under-explored. Given the rapid advancements in natural language processing, one unanswered question is how far we are from having a single ADE extraction model that is effective on various types of text, such as scientific literature and social media posts. Methods: We contribute to answering this question by building a multi-domain benchmark for adverse drug event extraction, which we named MULTIADE. The new benchmark comprises several existing datasets sampled from different text types and our newly created dataset—CADECV2, which is an extension of CADEC (Karimi et al., 2015), covering online posts regarding more diverse drugs than CADEC. Our new dataset is carefully annotated by human annotators following detailed annotation guidelines. Conclusion: Our benchmark results show that the generalisation of the trained models is far from perfect, making it infeasible to be deployed to process different types of text. In addition, although intermediate transfer learning is a promising approach to utilising existing resources, further investigation is needed on methods of domain adaptation, particularly cost-effective methods to select useful training instances. The newly created CADECV2 and the scripts for building the benchmark are publicly available at CSIRO's Data Portal (https://data.csiro.au/collection/csiro:62387).

However, the traditional model-free disproportionality analysis has been challenged by the insufficiency in investigating subgroup and confounders. These issues result in significant low-precision and biases in data mining for SAER. Methods: The Model-Driven Reporting Odds Ratio (MD-ROR) was proposed to bridge the gap between SAER database and explainable models for exploring individual and confounding effects. MD-ROR is grounded in a well-designed model, rather than a 2 × 2 cross table, for estimating AE-drug signals. Consequently, individual and confounding effects can be parameterized based on these models. We employed simulation data and the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. Result: The simulated data indicated the subgroup effects estimated by MD-ROR were unbiased and efficient. Moreover, the adjusted-MD-ROR demonstrated greater robustness against confounding biases than the crude ROR. Applying our method to the FAERS database suggested higher occurrences of drug interactions and cardiac adverse events induced by Midazolam in females compared to males. Conclusion: The study underscored that MD-ROR holds promise as a method for investigating individual and confounding effects in SAER databases. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: A.

Methods: Event reports from the first quarter of 2009 to the third quarter of 2023 were collected and analyzed. Detailed examinations of gender, age, reporter identity, and other aspects were conducted to reveal the fundamental characteristics of Asenapine-related adverse events. Signal mining techniques were employed to systematically evaluate various adverse reactions associated with Asenapine. Results: The study found that adverse event reports involving Asenapine were more common among female patients, with the age group mainly distributed between 18 and 45 years. Physicians were the primary reporters of adverse events, and psychiatric disorders, neurological disorders, and gastrointestinal disorders were the most common areas affected by adverse reactions. In addition to known adverse reactions, potential risks not mentioned in the drug label were identified, such as anosognosia, attentional drift, and psychogenic compensation disorder. Conclusion: Asenapine carries the risk of various adverse reactions alongside its therapeutic effects. In clinical practice, physicians should closely monitor the occurrence of neurological disorders, psychiatric disorders, and gastrointestinal system disorders. © The Author(s) 2024.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: G.

To address this gap, our study utilized a literature database, applied natural language processing (NLP) techniques, and conducted multi-source electronic health record (EHR) validation to uncover underrecognized DDI-SADR signals that warrant further investigation. PubMed abstracts related to DDIs from January 1962 to December 2023 were retrieved. We utilized PubTator Central for Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify drugs and SADRs and employed SciFive for Relation Extraction (RE) to extract DDI-SADR signals. The extracted signals were cross-referenced with the DrugBank database and validated using logistic regression, considering risk factors including patient demographics, drug usage, and comorbidities, based on EHRs from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) and the All of Us research program. From 160,321 abstracts, we identified 111 DDI-SADR signals. Seventeen were statistically significant (13 by one EHR and 4 by both EHR databases), with 9 being previously not recorded in the DrugBank. These included methadone-ciprofloxacin-respiratory depression, oxycodone-fluvoxamine-clonus, tramadol-fluconazole-hallucination, simvastatin-fluconazole-rhabdomyolysis, ibrutinib-amiodarone-atrial fibrillation, fentanyl-diltiazem-delirium, clarithromycin-voriconazole-acute kidney injury, colchicine-cyclosporine-rhabdomyolysis, and methadone-voriconazole-arrhythmia (odds ratios (ORs) ranged from 1.9 to 35.83, with P-values ranging from < 0.001 to 0.017). Utilizing NLP to extract DDI-SADRs from Biomedical Literature and validating these findings through multiple-source EHRs represents a pioneering approach in pharmacovigilance.

These pose a significant challenge in healthcare, ranging from mild discomfort to severe complications, and can impact patient safety and treatment outcomes. Methods: We explore the influence of domain shift between a set of dummy clinical notes and a real-world hospital corpus of Japanese clinical notes of breast cancer treatment when extracting ADEs from free text. We annotated a subset of the hospital dataset and used it to fine-tune a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model, initially trained with the set of dummy documents. We used increasing amounts of the annotated data and evaluated the impact on the model's performance. Additionally, we examined the extracted information to identify combinations of drugs that are likely to cause ADEs. Results: We show that domain adaptation can significantly improve model performance in the new domain, as by feeding a small subset of 100 documents for the fine-tuning process we saw a 40% improvement in model performance. However, we also noticed diminishing returns when fine-tuning the model with a larger dataset. For instance, by feeding eight times more data, we only saw further 18% improvement in extraction performance. Conclusion: While variations in writing style and vocabulary in clinical corpora can significantly impact the quality of NER results. We show that domain adaptation can be of great aid in mitigating these discrepancies and achieving better performance. Yet, while providing in-domain data to a model helps, there are diminishing returns when fine-tuning with large amounts of data. © 2024 The Author(s)","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: E.

Materials and methods: Data were extracted from publicly available Amazon reviews and analyzed using JMP 16 Pro Text Explorer. Topic modeling identified themes. Sentiment analysis (SA) explored consumer perceptions. A machine learning model optimized prediction of AEs in reviews. Reports for the same time interval and product class were obtained from the FAERS public dashboard and analyzed. Results: Homeopathic cough/cold products were the largest category common to both data sources (Amazon ¼ 616, FAERS ¼ 445) and were analyzed further. Oral symptoms and unpleasant taste were described in both datasets. Amazon reviews describing an AE had lower Amazon ratings (X2 ¼ 224.28, P < .0001). The optimal model for predicting AEs was Neural Boosted 5-fold combining topic modeling and Amazon ratings as predictors (mean AUC ¼ 0.927). Discussion: Topic modeling and SA of Amazon reviews provided information about consumers’ perceptions and opinions of homeopathic OTC cough and cold products. Amazon ratings appear to be a good indicator of the presence or absence of AEs, and identified events were similar to FAERS. Conclusion: Amazon reviews may complement traditional data sources to identify AEs associated with unapproved OTC homeopathic products.

However, the majority of current data comes from pre-marketing, with limited real-world studies. Our research aimed to explore post-marketing data of avapritinib. We evaluated the signals of avapritinib-related neuropsychiatric AEs by data mining using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information component (IC) were employed to quantify the signals from the first quarter of 2020 through the fourth quarter of 2023. Subsequently, stratified analyses were conducted to further explore the effect of different stratification schemes on the association between avapritinib and neuropsychiatric AEs. Finally, a combination medication analysis was conducted to explore the impact of the co-administration of neuropsychiatric AEs. A total of 2029 neuropsychiatric AEs were reported, and 49 signals were detected, of which 5 were determined to be new signals. Avapritinib was significantly associated with the occurrence of neuropsychiatric AEs (ROR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.44–1.61; IC: 0.43, IC025: 0.35). The stratified analysis found that gender, age and eight preferred terms (PTs), including cerebral haemorrhage, may affect the severity of AEs. Combination medication analysis showed that combining avapritinib with 19 other medications, including prochlorperazine, may increase the risk of neuropsychiatric AEs. The median time-to-onset (TTO) of avapritinib-related neuropsychiatric AEs was 32 (interquartile range [IQR] 2-200) days, with about 65% of cases occurring within the first three months of treatment.

By developing and refining prompt-based strategies, we can significantly enhance the models' performance, making them viable tools for clinical NER tasks and possibly reducing the reliance on extensive annotated datasets. Objectives: This study quantifies the capabilities of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for clinical named entity recognition (NER) tasks and proposes task-specific prompts to improve their performance. Materials and Methods: We evaluated these models on 2 clinical NER tasks: (1) to extract medical problems, treatments, and tests from clinical notes in the MTSamples corpus, following the 2010 i2b2 concept extraction shared task, and (2) to identify nervous system disorder-related adverse events from safety reports in the vaccine adverse event reporting system (VAERS). To improve the GPT models' performance, we developed a clinical task-specific prompt framework that includes (1) baseline prompts with task description and format specification, (2) annotation guideline-based prompts, (3) error analysis-based instructions, and (4) annotated samples for few-shot learning. We assessed each prompt's effectiveness and compared the models to BioClinicalBERT. Results: Using baseline prompts, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 achieved relaxed F1 scores of 0.634, 0.804 for MTSamples and 0.301, 0.593 for VAERS. Additional prompt components consistently improved model performance. When all 4 components were used, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 achieved relaxed F1 socres of 0.794, 0.861 for MTSamples and 0.676, 0.736 for VAERS, demonstrating the effectiveness of our prompt framework. Although these results trail BioClinicalBERT (F1 of 0.901 for the MTSamples dataset and 0.802 for the VAERS), it is very promising considering few training samples are needed. Discussion: The study's findings suggest a promising direction in leveraging LLMs for clinical NER tasks. However, while the performance of GPT models improved with task-specific prompts, there's a need for further development and refinement. LLMs like GPT-4 show potential in achieving close performance to state-of-the-art models like BioClinicalBERT, but they still require careful prompt engineering and understanding of task-specific knowledge. The study also underscores the importance of evaluation schemas that accurately reflect the capabilities and performance of LLMs in clinical settings. Conclusion: While direct application of GPT models to clinical NER tasks falls short of optimal performance, our task-specific prompt framework, incorporating medical knowledge and training samples, significantly enhances GPT models' feasibility for potential clinical applications.  © 2024 The Author(s).","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 119; Correspondence Address: H.

These results show that dillapiole is a potential PPARγ-agonist and thus needs to explore further. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: J.

The global prevalence of active epilepsy is around 6.38/1,000 persons and in the Arabian region, the median prevalence of active epilepsy is 4.4/1,000 persons. However, over 75% of individuals are untreated. Consequently, the development of therapeutic strategies with increased efficacy and safety profiles is essential to improve the survival rate among epilepsy patients. The current study integrates network pharmacology along with Bioinformatics approaches to explore the potential molecular mechanisms of local flora of Saudi Arabia including Solanum incanum, Abrus precatorius, Withania somnifera, and Azadirachta indica in epilepsy treatment. In the preliminary phase, data related to the bioactive components of the local plants and the associated target genes of both these plants and epilepsy were gathered from scientific literature and open-source databases. This data was then analyzed to identify common targets between the plants and ovarian cancer. Based on these common targets, a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed utilizing the STRING database, which was subsequently incorporated into the Cytoscape software for identification of hub genes based on their degree of connectivity. Lastly, an interplay network depicting the associations between the compounds and the overlapping genes was formulated via Cytoscape, to study the potential network pharmacology implications of these active compounds in relation to ovarian cancer. Following that, a compound-target protein-pathway network was constructed which uncovered that namely abrectorin, genistin, (+)-catechin, precatorine, (+)-ascorbic acid, licoflavanone, skrofulein, stigmasterone, 5,7-Dihydroxy-4′-methoxy-8,3′-di-C-prenylflavanone could potentially be used as antagonists for the therapeutic management of epilepsy by targeting TNF and TP53 proteins. Furthermore, the implementation of molecular docking reinforces the binding affinity of the compound, indicating a robust stability of the forecasted compounds at the docked site. This research lays both a theoretical and experimental groundwork for more profound investigations and establishes a practical method for the strategic employment of active compounds in the development of anti-epileptic therapeutics. © 2023 The Authors","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: F.

An indepth systematic analysis of opioid-related adverse events (AEs) can clarify the risks presented by opioid exposure, as well as the individual risk profiles of specific opioid drugs and the potential relationships among the opioids. In this study, 92 opioids were identified from the list of all Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, annotated by RxNorm and were classified into 13 opioid groups: buprenorphine, codeine, dihydrocodeine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, meperidine, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, tapentadol, and tramadol. A total of 14,970,399 AE reports were retrieved and downloaded from the FDA Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS) from 2004, Quarter 1 to 2020, Quarter 3. After data processing, Empirical Bayes Geometric Mean (EBGM) was then applied which identified 3317 pairs of potential risk signals within the 13 opioid groups. Based on these potential safety signals, a comparative analysis was pursued to provide a global overview of opioid-related AEs for all 13 groups of FDA-approved prescription opioids. The top 10 most reported AEs for each opioid class were then presented. Both network analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis were conducted to further explore the relationship between opioids. Results from the network analysis revealed a close association among fentanyl, oxycodone, hydrocodone, and hydromorphone, which shared more than 22 AEs. In addition, much less commonly reported AEs were shared among dihydrocodeine, meperidine, oxymorphone, and tapentadol. On the contrary, the hierarchical clustering analysis further categorized the 13 opioid classes into two groups by comparing the full profiles of presence/absence of AEs. The results of network analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis were not only consistent and cross-validated each other but also provided a better and deeper understanding of the associations and relationships between the 13 opioid groups with respect to their adverse effect profiles. © 2023 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: W.

Extracting temporal relationships between medical events is essential to reveal hidden patterns that can help physicians find optimal treatments, diagnose illnesses, detect drug adverse reactions, and more. This paper presents an approach for the extraction of patient evolution patterns from electronic health records written in Catalan and/or Spanish. Methods: We propose a robust formulation for extracting Temporal Association Rules (TARs) that goes beyond simple rule extraction by considering the sequence of multiple visits. Our highly configurable algorithm leverages this formulation to extract Temporal Association Rules from sequences of medical instances. We can generate rules in the desired format, content, and temporal factors while accounting for different levels of abstraction of medical instances. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology, we applied it to extract patient evolution patterns from clinical histories of multimorbid patients suffering from heart disease and stroke who visited Primary Care Centers (CAP) in Catalonia. Our main objective is to uncover complex rules with multiple temporal steps, that comprise a set of medical instances. Results: As we are working with real-world, error-prone data, we propose a process of validation of the results by expert practitioners in primary care. Despite our limited dataset, the high percentage of patterns deemed correct and relevant by the experts is promising. The insights gained from these patterns can inform preventive measures and help detect risk factors, ultimately leading to better treatments and outcomes for patients. Conclusion: Our algorithm successfully extracted a set of meaningful and relevant temporal patterns, especially for the specific type of multimorbid patients considered. These patterns were evaluated by experts and demonstrated the ability to predict risk factors that are commonly associated with certain diseases. Moreover, the average time gap between the occurrence of medical events provided critical insight into the term of these risk factors. This information holds significant value in the context of primary healthcare and preventive medicine, highlighting the potential of our method to serve as a valuable medical tool. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: A.

Predicting the probability of side-effects, before their occurrence, is fundamental to reduce this impact, in particular on drug discovery. Candidate molecules could be screened before undergoing clinical trials, reducing the costs in time, money, and health of the participants. Drug side-effects are triggered by complex biological processes involving many different entities, from drug structures to protein-protein interactions. To predict their occurrence, it is necessary to integrate data from heterogeneous sources. In this work, such heterogeneous data is integrated into a graph dataset, expressively representing the relational information between different entities, such as drug molecules and genes. The relational nature of the dataset represents an important novelty for drug side-effect predictors. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are exploited to predict DSEs on our dataset with very promising results. GNNs are deep learning models that can process graph-structured data, with minimal information loss, and have been applied on a wide variety of biological tasks. Our experimental results confirm the advantage of using relationships between data entities, suggesting interesting future developments in this scope. The experimentation also shows the importance of specific subsets of data in determining associations between drugs and side-effects.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 20; Correspondence Address: P.

Despite the popularity of TCIM among patients with cancer, few related studies have used data from these web-based sources to explore the use of TCIM among patients with cancer. Objective: This study leveraged multiple forums and social media platforms to explore patients’ use, interest, and perception of TCIM for cancer care. Methods: Posts (in English) related to TCIM were collected from Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and 16 health forums from inception until February 2022. Both manual assessments and natural language processing were performed. Descriptive analyses were performed to explore the most commonly discussed TCIM modalities for each symptom and cancer type. Sentiment analyses were performed to measure the polarity of each post or comment, and themes were identified from posts with positive and negative sentiments. TCIM modalities that are emerging or recommended in the guidelines were identified a priori. Exploratory topic-modeling analyses with latent Dirichlet allocation were conducted to investigate the patients’ perceptions of these modalities. Results: Among the 1,620,755 posts available, cancer-related symptoms, such as pain (10/10, 100% cancer types), anxiety and depression (9/10, 90%), and poor sleep (9/10, 90%), were commonly discussed. Cannabis was among the most frequently discussed TCIM modalities for pain in 7 (70%) out of 10 cancer types, as well as nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, anxiety and depression, and poor sleep. A total of 7 positive and 7 negative themes were also identified. The positive themes included TCIM, making symptoms manageable, and reducing the need for medication and their side effects. The belief that TCIM and conventional treatments were not mutually exclusive and intolerance to conventional treatment may facilitate TCIM use. Conversely, TCIM was viewed as leading to patients’ refusal of conventional treatment or delays in diagnosis and treatment. Doctors’ ignorance regarding TCIM and the lack of information provided about TCIM may be barriers to its use. Exploratory analyses showed that TCIM recommendations were well discussed among patients; however, these modalities were also used for many other indications. Other notable topics included concerns about the legalization of cannabis, acupressure techniques, and positive experiences of meditation. Conclusions: Using machine learning techniques, social media and health forums provide a valuable resource for patient-generated data regarding the pattern of use and patients’ perceptions of TCIM. Such information will help clarify patients’ needs and concerns and provide directions for research on integrating TCIM into cancer care. Our results also suggest that effective communication about TCIM should be achieved and that doctors should be more open-minded to actively discuss TCIM use with their patients. ©Chun Sing Lam, Keary Zhou, Herbert Ho-Fung Loong, Vincent Chi-Ho Chung, Chun-Kit Ngan, Yin Ting Cheung.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 8; Correspondence Address: Y.T.

Pantoprazole, the most commonly over-utilized Over The Counter (OTC) medication, was selected to assess any short-term or long-term AEs. The study aimed to analyze the novel adverse events of pantoprazole using the FAERS database. Materials and methods: A retrospective case/non-case disproportionality analysis was performed in the FAERS database. This study was based on AEs reported to FAERS from 2006Q1-2021Q3. Openvigil 2.1 was used for data extraction. Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), and Information Component (IC) were applied to measure the disproportionality in reporting. A value of ROR-1.96SE > 1, PRR ≥ 2, and IC-2SD > 0 were considered as the threshold for a positive signal. Results: A total of 1050 reports of dyspepsia, 7248 reports of hypocalcemia and 995 reports of hyponatremia were identified. A potential positive signal for dyspepsia (ROR-1.96SE = 2.231, PRR = 2.359, IC-2SD = 1.13), hypocalcemia (4.961, 5.45, 2.23) and hyponatremia (3.948, 4.179, 1.92) were identified for pantoprazole.

Previous studies on ocular adverse reactions of antipsychotics were mainly focused on typical antipsychotics. Systematic research on atypical antipsychotics remains limited. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the potential risks of different atypical antipsychotics causing ocular side effects by mining the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. Methods: Extract reports from the FAERS from the first quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2022 were obtained. Data mining of eye disorders associated with atypical antipsychotics was carried out using The Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) method and The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) method to determine positive signals. Results: FAERS reports for 9913783 cases were included in these 28 quarters. 64 defined ocular adverse events were classified into 10 categories according to High-Level Group Terms (HLGT). Conclusions: There were differences in the types and severity of ocular-related adverse events associated with atypical antipsychotics. Ocular neuromuscular-related adverse events were found among all 11 atypical antipsychotics. Olanzapine had the highest signal intensity in oculogyric crisis. Aripiprazole had the highest signal strength in blepharospasm. Cariprazine was associated with cataract-related ocular adverse reactions.

The increasing number of multiple-drug prescriptions leads to the rise of drug–drug interactions (DDIs) and DFIs. These adverse interactions lead to other implications, e.g., the decline in medicament’s effect, the withdrawals of various medications, and harmful impacts on the patients’ health. However, the importance of DFIs remains underestimated, as the number of studies on these topics is constrained. Recently, scientists have applied artificial intelligence-based models to study DFIs. However, there were still some limitations in data mining, input, and detailed annotations. This study proposed a novel prediction model to address the limitations of previous studies. In detail, we extracted 70,477 food compounds from the FooDB database and 13,580 drugs from the DrugBank database. We extracted 3780 features from each drug–food compound pair. The optimal model was eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). We also validated the performance of our model on one external test set from a previous study which contained 1922 DFIs. Finally, we applied our model to recommend whether a drug should or should not be taken with some food compounds based on their interactions. The model can provide highly accurate and clinically relevant recommendations, especially for DFIs that may cause severe adverse events and even death. Our proposed model can contribute to developing more robust predictive models to help patients, under the supervision and consultants of physicians, avoid DFI adverse effects in combining drugs and foods for therapy. © 2023 by the authors.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 48; Correspondence Address: N.Q.K.

It is challenging because DDIs are related to multiple factors, such as genes, drug molecular structure, diseases, biological processes, side effects, etc. It is a crucial technology for Knowledge graph to present multi-relation among entities. Recently some existing graph-based computation models have been proposed for DDIs prediction and get good performance. However, there are still some challenges in the knowledge graph representation, which can extract rich latent features from drug knowledge graph (KG). Results: In this work, we propose a novel multi-view feature representation and fusion (MuFRF) architecture to realize DDIs prediction. It consists of two views of feature representation and a multi-level latent feature fusion. For the feature representation from the graph view and KG view, we use graph isomorphism network to map drug molecular structures and use RotatE to implement the vector representation on bio-medical knowledge graph, respectively. We design concatenate-level and scalar-level strategies in the multi-level latent feature fusion to capture latent features from drug molecular structure information and semantic features from bio-medical KG. And the multi-head attention mechanism achieves the optimization of features on binary and multi-class classification tasks. We evaluate our proposed method based on two open datasets in the experiments. Experiments indicate that MuFRF outperforms the classic and state-of-the-art models. Conclusions: Our proposed model can fully exploit and integrate the latent feature from the drug molecular structure graph (graph view) and rich bio-medical knowledge graph (KG view). We find that a multi-view feature representation and fusion model can accurately predict DDIs. It may contribute to providing with some guidance for research and validation for discovering novel DDIs. © 2023, The Author(s).","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 13; Correspondence Address: R.

In vitro studies have shown that BPs induce cytotoxicity, inhibit wound healing, and thus affect periodontal disease. Denosumab and BPs have alternative indications. BP and denosumab are not known to correlate with gingival disorders. We assessed such a relationship by applying Bayesian and nonproportional analyses to data in the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. The study analyzed BPs and denosumab-reported incidents with preferred terms found in the narrow Standardized MedDRA Queries for gingival disorders. A total of 5863 reported cases of gingival disorders were associated with five BPs (alendronate, pamidronate, ibandronate, risedronate, and zoledronate) and denosumab. More than 15% of patients with gingival disorders related to BPs and denosumab other than denosumab were hospitalized over short- or long-term periods. Our findings indicated BPs and denosumab had significant reporting odds ratios (ROR), proportional reporting ratios (PRR), and information components (IC) with respect to gingival disorders. Pamidronate had the highest association (ROR = 64.58, PRR = 57.99, IC = 5.71), while the weakest association was found with denosumab (ROR = 3.61, PRR = 3.60, IC = 1.77). Significant associations were found between the six drugs and gingival pain, gingival recession, gingivitis, periodontal disease, and periodontitis. In conclusion, our comprehensive overview of the correlations, clinical characteristics, and prognoses of BPs and denosumab-related gingival disorders suggests that these issues deserve continued surveillance and appropriate management.

Complementing its real-time surveillance for pre-specified health outcomes using pre-specified risk intervals, the VSD conducts tree-based data-mining to look for clustering of a broad range of health outcomes after COVID-19 vaccination. This study's objective was to use this untargeted, hypothesis-generating approach to assess the safety of first booster doses of Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2), Moderna (mRNA-1273), and Janssen (Ad26.COV2.S) COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: VSD enrollees receiving a first booster of COVID-19 vaccine through April 2, 2022 were followed for 56 days. Incident diagnoses in inpatient or emergency department settings were analyzed for clustering within both the hierarchical ICD-10-CM code structure and the follow-up period. The self-controlled tree-temporal scan statistic was used, conditioning on the total number of cases for each diagnosis. P-values were estimated by Monte Carlo simulation; p = 0.01 was pre-specified as the cut-off for statistical significance of clusters. Results: More than 2.4 and 1.8 million subjects received Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna boosters after an mRNA primary series, respectively. Clusters of urticaria/allergy/rash were found during Days 10–15 after the Moderna booster (p = 0.0001). Other outcomes that clustered after mRNA boosters, mostly with p = 0.0001, included unspecified adverse effects, common vaccine-associated reactions like fever and myalgia, and COVID-19. COVID-19 clusters were in Days 1–10 after booster receipt, before boosters would have become effective. There were no noteworthy clusters after boosters following primary Janssen vaccination. Conclusions: In this untargeted data-mining study of COVID-19 booster vaccination, a cluster of delayed-onset urticaria/allergy/rash was detected after the Moderna booster, as has been reported after Moderna vaccination previously. Other clusters after mRNA boosters were of unspecified or common adverse effects and COVID-19, the latter evidently reflecting immunity to COVID-19 after 10 days. © 2022 The Author(s)","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 3; CODEN: VACCD</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Usa dados de Vacinas | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Vacinas",10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.11.053,"Data Mining;data mining;Humans;Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions;COVID-19;Data-mining;Epidemiologic research design;Vaccination;Vaccines;adverse event;adverse drug reaction;drug safety;human;risk assessment;adult;aged;female;male;fever;atopic dermatitis;rash;urticaria;treatment outcome;follow up;drug efficacy;coronavirus disease 2019;myalgia;SARS-CoV-2 vaccine;allergy;emergency ward;ICD-10-CM;hospital patient;Monte Carlo method;information system;Article;prevention and control;COVID-19 Vaccines;Dermatitis, Atopic;Ad26COVS1;BNT162 Vaccine;Exanthema;Urticaria",,

Methods: Adverse event reports related to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from the first quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2023 were extracted, and the reported Odds ratio methods (ROR method) and comprehensive standard methods (MHRA methods) were used for data mining and analysis. Results: A total of 5,322 reports (accounts for 6.68% of the total reports)of AEs in endocrine system were collected, including 1852 of pabolizumab (34.80%), 2,326 of navuliumab (43.71%), 54 of cimipriliumab (1.01%), 800 of atilizumab (15.03%), 222 of duvariumab (4.17%) and 68 of averumab (1.28%). Endocrine system-related AEs were mainly present in men (excluding those treated with pembrolizumab) aged ≥65 years. The ratio of AEs components in the endocrine system for the six drugs was approximately 3–8%. The main endocrine glands involved in AEs were the thyroid (pembrolizumab), pituitary and adrenal (nivolumab), adrenal (cemiplimab, atezolizumab, and avelumab), and thyroid (durvalumab). Most patients experienced AEs between 30 and 365 (mean, 117) days,the median time was 61d. AEs resulted in prolonged hospitalization in >40% and death in >10% of cases after administration of pembrolizumab, nivolumab, or durvalumab. Conclusion: Men aged ≥65 years should be concerned about endocrine-related AEs. There was a lengthy interval between the use of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and endocrine system-related AEs, but the outcome was serious. Special attention should be given to endocrine system-related AEs when using pembrolizumab, nivolumab, or durvalumab.

Instead, we used tree-based data-mining to look more broadly for possible adverse events after Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Janssen COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: Vaccine Safety Datalink enrollees receiving ≥1 dose of COVID-19 vaccine in 2020–2021 were followed for 70 days after Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna and 56 days after Janssen vaccination. Incident diagnoses in inpatient or emergency department settings were analyzed for clustering within both the hierarchical ICD-10-CM code structure and the post-vaccination follow-up period. We used the self-controlled tree-temporal scan statistic and TreeScan software. Monte Carlo simulation was used to estimate p-values; p = 0.01 was the pre-specified cut-off for statistical significance of a cluster. Results: There were 4.1, 2.6, and 0.4 million Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Janssen vaccinees, respectively. Clusters after Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination included: (1) unspecified adverse effects, (2) common vaccine reactions, such as fever, myalgia, and headache, (3) myocarditis/pericarditis, and (4) less specific cardiac or respiratory symptoms, all with the strongest clusters generally after Dose 2; and (5) COVID-19/viral pneumonia/sepsis/respiratory failure in the first 3 weeks after Dose 1. Moderna results were similar but without a significant myocarditis/pericarditis cluster. Further investigation suggested the fifth signal group was a manifestation of mRNA vaccine effectiveness after the first 3 weeks. Janssen vaccinees had clusters of unspecified or common vaccine reactions, gait/mobility abnormalities, and muscle weakness. The latter two were deemed to have arisen from confounding related to practices at one site. Conclusions: We detected post-vaccination clusters of unspecified adverse effects, common vaccine reactions, and, for the mRNA vaccines, chest pain and palpitations, as well as myocarditis/pericarditis after Pfizer-BioNTech Dose 2. Unique advantages of this data mining are its untargeted nature and its inherent adjustment for the multiplicity of diagnoses and risk intervals scanned. © 2022 The Author(s)","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 10; CODEN: VACCD</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Usa dados de Vacinas | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Vacinas",10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.12.026,Data Mining;data mining;Humans;Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions;COVID-19;adverse event;adverse drug reaction;drug safety;vaccination;human;adult;female;major clinical study;male;fever;heart disease;respiratory tract disease;myocarditis;coronavirus disease 2019;headache;muscle weakness;myalgia;elasomeran;tozinameran;cluster analysis;gait disorder;pericarditis;Article;prevention and control;COVID-19 Vaccines;ad26.cov2.s vaccine;Cluster Analysis;Myocarditis,,

However, the long-term safety of mesalazine in large sample population was unknown. The current study was to assess mesalazine -related adverse events of real-world through data mining of the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Methods: Disproportionality analyses, including the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network and the multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS) algorithms were employed to quantify the signals of mesalazine -associated AEs. Results: Out of 14,149,980 reports collected from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database, 24,284 reports of mesalazine -associated AEs were identified. A total of 170 significant disproportionality preferred terms conforming to the four algorithms simultaneously were retained. The most common AEs included colitis ulcerative, diarrhoea, condition aggravated, crohn’s disease, fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea, haematochezia, which were corresponding to those reported in the specification and clinical trials. Unexpected significant AEs as dizziness, drug ineffective, drug hypersensitivity, infection, off label use, weight decreased, decreased appetite, arthralgia, rash might also occur. The median onset time of mesalazine -related AEs was 1,127 days (interquartile range [IQR] 1,127–1,674 days), and most of the cases occurred 2 years later (n = 610, 70.93%) and within the first 1 month (n = 89, 10.35%) after mesalazine initiation. Conclusion: Results of our study were consistent with clinical observations. We also found potential new and unexpected AEs signals for mesalazine, suggesting prospective clinical studies were needed to confirm these results and illustrate their relationship.

We aimed to analyze the characteristics of drug associated anaphylaxis, and to compare the differences among different drugs. Methods: A disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis were used in data mining to identify suspected anaphylaxis associated with AIT, omalizumab, and dupilumab based on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from January 2004 to March 2021. Demographic information, time interval to onset, and death rates of AIT, omalizumab, and dupilumab associated anaphylaxis were also analyzed. Results: Totally 9,969 anaphylactic events were identified. Reports of AIT, omalizumab, and dupilumab associated anaphylactic events were 64, 7,784, and 2,121, respectively. AIT had a high reporting odds ratio (ROR) of 5.03 [95%confidental interval (CI) 3.69–6.85], followed by omalizumab (ROR 2.24, 95% CI 2.18–2.29), and dupilumab had a negative signal for anaphylaxis. In children, most anaphylactic reactions (68%) were reported in the 12–17-year-old group. More reports of anaphylaxis related to AIT were in boys (73%), while more reports of anaphylaxis related to omalizumab (63%) and dupilumab (58%) were in girls. Most symptoms occurred on the day of drug initiation. The death rate of AIT related anaphylaxis was the lowest (0%), the death rate of omalizumab was 0.87%, while the death rate of dupilumab was 4.76%. No significant differences were observed among these drugs. Conclusion: AIT and omalizumab had a positive signal for anaphylaxis, while dupilumab had a negative signal for anaphylaxis. Patients should be strictly monitored after administration of AIT and also biologics. It also gives us a suggestion for choosing a combined biologics with AIT when the risk of anaphylaxis was considered. © Copyright © 2021 Bian, Zhang, Li, Wang, Cui, Xu, Guan, Zhao and Chen.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 16; Correspondence Address: K.

Due to the lack of understanding of the oncogenic mechanisms between muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) and advanced bladder cancer (ABC) and the limitations of current treatments, novel therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. In this study, we utilized the systems biology method via genome-wide microarray data to explore the oncogenic mechanisms of MIBC and ABC to identify their respective drug targets for systems drug discovery. First, we constructed the candidate genome-wide genetic and epigenetic networks (GWGEN) through big data mining. Second, we applied the system identification and system order detection method to delete false positives in candidate GWGENs to obtain the real GWGENs of MIBC and ABC from their genome-wide microarray data. Third, we extracted the core GWGENs from the real GWGENs by selecting the significant proteins, genes and epigenetics via the principal network projection (PNP) method. Finally, we obtained the core signaling pathways from the corresponding core GWGEN through the annotations of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway to investigate the carcinogenic mechanisms of MIBC and ABC. Based on the carcinogenic mechanisms, we selected the significant drug targets NFKB1, LEF1 and MYC for MIBC, and LEF1, MYC, NOTCH1 and FOXO1 for ABC. To design molecular drug combinations for MIBC and ABC, we employed a deep neural network (DNN)-based drug-target interaction (DTI) model with drug specifications. The DNN-based DTI model was trained by drug-target interaction databases to predict the candidate drugs for MIBC and ABC, respectively. Subsequently, the drug design specifications based on regulation ability, sensitivity and toxicity were employed as filter criteria for screening the potential drug combinations of Embelin and Obatoclax for MIBC, and Obatoclax, Entinostat and Imiquimod for ABC from their candidate drugs. In conclusion, we not only investigated the oncogenic mechanisms of MIBC and ABC, but also provided promising therapeutic options for MIBC and ABC, respectively. © 2022 by the authors.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 6; Correspondence Address: B.-S.

We sought to characterize the frequency, severity, type, and anatomic location of TEEs reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) following Ad.26.COV2.S. Methods: Reports of TEEs after Ad.26.COV2.S were identified in VAERS, and demographics, clinical characteristics, and relevant medical history were summarized. For a subset of reports, physicians reviewed available medical records and evaluated clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, risk factors, and treatment. The crude reporting rate of TEEs was estimated based on case counts in VAERS and vaccine administration data. Results: Through February 28, 2022, FDA identified 3790 reports of TEEs after Ad.26.COV2.S. Median age was 56 years, and 1938 individuals (51.1%) were female. Most reports, 2892 (76.3%), were serious, including 421 deaths. Median time to onset was 12 days post-vaccination. Obesity and ischemia were among the most commonly documented risk factors. Thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 150 000/μl) was documented in 63 records (11.5%) and anti-platelet 4 antibodies in 25 (4.6%). Medical review identified cases of severe clot burden (e.g., bilateral, saddle, or other massive pulmonary embolism with or without cor pulmonale; lower extremity thrombus involving the external iliac, common femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, peroneal, and gastrocnemius veins). The crude reporting rate was ~20.7 cases of TEE per 100 000 doses of Ad.26.COV2.S administered. Conclusions: Life-threatening or fatal TEEs have been reported after Ad.26.COV2.S, including bilateral massive pulmonary embolism or other severe clot burden. Published 2022.

In this research project, we evaluated a natural language processing (NLP) tool’s ability to extract four demographic variables (gender, weight, ethnicity, race) from ICSR narratives. Specificity of the NLP algorithm was over 94% for all demographics, while sensitivity varied between the demographics: 98.6% (gender), 45.5% (weight), 100% (ethnicity), and 85.3% (race). Among ICSRs missing weight, ethnicity, and race in the structured field, few cases had this information in the narrative (>95% missing); consequently, the positive predictive value (PPV) for these three demographics had wide 95% confidence intervals. After NLP implementation, the total number of ICSRs missing gender was reduced by 33% (i.e., NLP identified 472 thousand reports having a gender value in the narrative that was not in the structured field), while the total number of ICSRs missing weight, ethnicity, or race was reduced by less than 4%. This study demonstrated that the implementation of an NLP tool can provide meaningful improvements in the availability of gender information for pharmacovigilance activities conducted with FAERS data. In contrast, NLP tools targeting the extraction of weight, ethnicity, or race from free-text fields have minimal impact largely because the information was infrequently provided by the reporter. Further gains in completeness of these fields must originate from increases in provision of demographic information from the reporter rather than informatic solutions.

Evaluating drug safety is especially challenging in children due to the processes of growth and maturation, which can alter how children respond to treatment. Current drug safety-signal-detection methods do not account for these dynamics. Methods: We recently developed a method called disproportionality generalized additive models (dGAMs) to better identify safety signals for drugs across child-development stages. Findings: We used dGAMs on a database of 264,453 pediatric adverse-event reports and found 19,438 ADEs signals associated with development and validated these signals against a small reference set of pediatric ADEs. Using our approach, we can hypothesize on the ontogenic dynamics of ADE signals, such as that montelukast-induced psychiatric disorders appear most significant in the second year of life. Additionally, we integrated pediatric enzyme expression data and found that pharmacogenes with dynamic childhood expression, such as CYP2C18 and CYP27B1, are associated with pediatric ADEs. Conclusions: We curated KidSIDES, a database of pediatric drug safety signals, for the research community and developed the Pediatric Drug Safety portal (PDSportal) to facilitate evaluation of drug safety signals across childhood growth and development.

The reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), and Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) were used to detect the risk signals. A suspicious signal was generated only if the results of the three algorithms were all positive. A total of 10,756 reports were identified commonly observed in hepatobiliary, endocrine, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, metabolic, and nutrition system. 40 suspicious signals were generated, and therein 20 signals were not included in the label. Severe high signals (i.e. progressive extraocular muscle paralysis, acute pancreatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, acquired lipodystrophy and mitochondrial toxicity) were identified. In pregnant women, umbilical cord abnormality, fetal growth restriction, low birth weight, stillbirth, premature rupture of membranes, premature birth and spontaneous abortion showed positive signals. Darunavir and its boosted agents induced AEs in various organs/tissues, and were shown to be possibly associated with multiple adverse pregnant conditions.

Methods: According to the FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), from January 2004 to July 2021, the data of suspected SJS after the use of vancomycin and linezolid were analyzed by imbalance and Bayesian analysis. The onset time, fatality rate and hospitalization rate of vancomycin-associated SJS and linezolid-associated SJS were also investigated. Results: 276 cases of vancomycin-related SJS reports and 63 cases of linezolid-related SJS reports were identified. These two drugs are more common in middle-aged patients (45–64 years) than other age groups, and less common in underage children (<18). Among them, linezolid-related SJS is more common in middle-aged and elderly patients (45–74 years old) than other groups. Except for unspecified data, in vancomycin-associated SJS cases, there are more men than women (49.28% vs 43.84%), while in linezolid-associated SJS cases, the proportion of men and women is almost equal (44.44%). From the point of view of the areas where adverse reactions were reported, about 1/2 of the reports on Vancomycin-related SJS came from North America, and 1/3 of the reports came from Europe. The median onset time of Linezolid-related SJS was 5 days (interquartile range [IQR] 2–7.75), which was significantly earlier than that of Vancomycin-related SJS (12 days, IQR 4–20) (Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.0001). There were no significant differences in mortality and hospitalization rates after vancomycin and linezolid caused SJS. Conclusion: The analysis of faers data provides a comprehensive overview of the adverse reactions of SJS caused by the use of vancomycin and linezolid, and can warn clinical workers to timely intervene and continuously monitor the patients at risk of SJS when using such drugs.

Methods: Based on the semi-structured data of Chinese Electronic Medical Records (CEMRs) from the China Hospital Pharmacovigilance System, this paper proposed a bi-level artificial intelligence model for the risk classification of acute respiratory diseases. It includes two levels. The first level is a dedicated design of the “BiLSTM+Dilated Convolution+3D Attention+CRF” deep learning model that is used for Chinese Clinical Named Entity Recognition (CCNER) to extract valuable information from the unstructured data in the CEMRs. Incorporating the transfer learning and semi-supervised learning technique into the proposed deep learning model achieves higher accuracy and efficiency in the CCNER task than the popular “Bert+BiLSTM+CRF” approach. Combining the extracted entity data with other structured data in the CEMRs, the second level is a customized XGBoost to realize the risk classification of acute respiratory diseases. Results: The empirical study shows that the proposed model could provide practical technical support for improving diagnostic accuracy. Conclusion: Our study provides a proof-of-concept for implementing a hybrid artificial intelligence-based system as a tool to aid clinicians in tackling CEMR data and enhancing the diagnostic evaluation under diagnostic uncertainty. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 11; Correspondence Address: P.

Limited data are available on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines administered during and around the time of pregnancy. Objective: To evaluate and summarize reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a national spontaneous reporting system, in pregnant persons who received a COVID-19 vaccine to assess for potential vaccine safety problems. Methods: We searched VAERS for US reports of adverse events (AEs) in pregnant persons who received a COVID-19 vaccine from 12/14/2020–10/31/2021. Clinicians reviewed reports and available medical records. Crude reporting rates for selected AEs were calculated, and disproportional reporting was assessed using data mining methods. Results: VAERS received 3,462 reports of AEs in pregnant persons who received a COVID-19 vaccine; 1,831 (52.9%) after BNT162b2, 1,350 (38.9%) after mRNA-1273, and 275 (7.9%) after Ad26.COV2.S. Eight maternal deaths and 12 neonatal deaths were reported. Six-hundred twenty-one (17.9%) reports were serious. Pregnancy-specific outcomes included: 878 spontaneous abortions (<20 weeks), 101 episodes of vaginal bleeding, 76 preterm deliveries (<37 weeks), 62 stillbirths (≥20 weeks), and 33 outcomes with birth defects. Crude reporting rates for preterm deliveries and stillbirths, as well as maternal and neonatal mortality rates were below background rates from published sources. No disproportional reporting for any AE was observed. Conclusions: Review of reports to VAERS following COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant persons did not identify any concerning patterns of maternal or infant-fetal outcomes. © 2022","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 30; Correspondence Address: P.L.

Bedaquiline belongs to the class of diarylquinolines, which are antituberculosis drugs that are quite different mechanistically from quinolines and flouroquinolines. The fact that relatively similar chemical drugs produce different mechanisms of action is still not widely understood. To enhance discrimination in favor of bedaquiline, a new approach using eight-score principal component analysis (PCA), provided by a ChemGPS-NP model, is proposed. PCA scores were calculated based on 35 + 1 different physicochemical properties and demonstrated clear differences when compared with other quinolines. The ChemGPS-NP model provided an exceptional 100 compounds nearest to bedaquiline from antituberculosis screening sets (with a cumulative Euclidian distance of 196.83), compared with the different 2Dsimilarity provided by Tanimoto methods (extended connective fingerprints and the Molecular ACCess System, showing 30% and 182% increases in cumulative Euclidian distance, respectively).

Observational studies suggested increasing risk of kidney injury in patients with PPIs treatment. We gathered six PPI regimens and adverse reports of acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) based on US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database from 2004 to 2019. We employed reporting odds ratio (ROR) to detect signals. Finally, we identified 3187 PPIs-associated AKI cases and 3457 PPIs-associated CKD cases. We detected significant signals between PPIs and AKI as well as CKD. The signal strength was stronger for CKD (ROR = 8.80, 95% CI 8.49–9.13) than AKI (ROR = 3.95, 95% CI 3.81–4.10), while dexlansoprazole performed stronger association for CKD (ROR = 34.94, 95% CI 30.89–39.53) and AKI (ROR = 8.18, 95% CI 7.04–9.51) than the other five PPIs. The median time from PPIs use to event occurrence was 23 days for AKI and 177 days for CKD. PPIs-associated AKI resulted larger proportion of death, life-threatening, hospitalization and disability events than PPIs-associated CKD. By mining the FAERS big data, we provided more information between PPIs use and the AKI and CKD events.

Method: A bibliographic search using a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) descriptors and free-text terms on CRI was performed using PubMed, followed by a double-blind review in order to select a list of candidate best papers to be then peer-reviewed by external reviewers. After peer-review ranking, a consensus meeting between two section editors and the editorial team was organized to finally conclude on the selected four best papers. Results: Among the 877 papers published in 2020 and returned by the search, there were four best papers selected. The first best paper describes a method for mining temporal sequences from clinical documents to infer disease trajectories and enhancing high-throughput phenotyping. The authors of the second best paper demonstrate that the generation of synthetic Electronic Health Record (EHR) data through Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) could be substantially improved by more appropriate training and evaluation criteria. The third best paper offers an efficient advance on methods to detect adverse drug events by computer-assisting expert reviewers with annotated candidate mentions in clinical documents. The large-scale data quality assessment study reported by the fourth best paper has clinical research informatics implications, in terms of the trustworthiness of inferences made from analysing electronic health records. Conclusions: The most significant research efforts in the CRI field are currently focusing on data science with active research in the development and evaluation of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) algorithms based on ever more intensive use of real-world data and especially EHR real or synthetic data. A major lesson that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has already taught the scientific CRI community is that timely international high-quality data-sharing and collaborative data analysis is absolutely vital to inform policy decisions. © 2021 Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc..

Methods: Review and describe the AEFI reported to national adverse event following immunization surveillance system (NAEFISS) in Zhejiang province from 2017 to 2020. Reporting rates of AEFI were calculated by age, city, severity of AEFI, categories of AEFI, and reaction categories. The data mining algorithm used in this study was reporting odds ratio (ROR). A value of ROR-1.96SE >1 (standard error [SE]) was considered as the positive signal. Results: NAEFISS received 3332 AEFI cases following PCV13, with a reporting rate of 17.58/10000 doses. Of the reported AEFI, 652 were serious AEFI cases and the reporting rate was 3.44 for serious AEFI. The reporting rate of fever was the highest among all the clinical diagnosis (7.39/10000 doses). The positive signals were obtained for injection site reaction (ROR-1.96SE: 1.55), hypotonic hyporesponsive episode (HHE) (ROR-1.96SE: 1.62) and febrile seizure (ROR-1.96SE: 1.52). Conclusion: The present results supported previous observations that the PCV13 administered as the four-dose schedule was generally well tolerated in Chinese infants as we did not identify any new/unexpected safety concern from the NAEFISS during a four-year time period. © 2022 Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

We aimed to identify and characterize fracture-related adverse events that are associated with SGLT2is. Materials and Methods: In this observational, retrospective, pharmacovigilance, real-world study, we used disproportionality and Bayesian analyses to compare fracture-related adverse event reporting in patients who received SGLT2is from the first quarter in 2004 to the fourth quarter in 2019 in the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System. We also compared the effect on combined therapy with SGLT2is and other glucose-lowering medications (GLMs), and compared their onset times and outcomes. Results: A total of 317 SGLT2is-associated fractures were identified. Affected patients tended to be aged >45 years (68.76%) and were more often male than female (58.04% vs 34.07%). SGLT2is-associated fracture is most commonly reported with canagliflozin (51.10%), dapagliflozin (24.60%) and empagliflozin (23.66%). SGLT2is or SGLT2is combined with GLMs do not show an association with fracture risk under disproportionality and Bayesian analyses. SGLT2i-associated fractures result in hospitalization in 66.64% of patients and death in 9.38% of patients. GLMs show an increased hospitalization rate compared with SGLT2is (69.72% vs 55.14%, P < 0.0001) and GLMs plus SGLT2is (69.72% vs 61.20%, P = 0.0197). Conclusions: Based on the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database, no association is noted between fracture risk and SGLT2is, or SGLT2is combined with GLMs. Long-term follow up and high-quality studies need to further verify and explore the relationship between SGLT2is and fractures. © 2020 The Authors.

Emerging case reports have raised awareness of cutaneous toxicities, which may be a potentially fatal complication. Objective: To assess the potential relevance between EV and cutaneous toxicities reports through data mining of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adverse event reporting system (FAERS). Methods: Data from January 1, 2019, to November 4, 2021, in the FAERS database were retrieved. Information component (IC) and reporting odds ratio (ROR) were used to evaluate the association between EV and cutaneous toxicities events. Results: EV was significantly associated with cutaneous toxicities in the database compared with both all other drugs (ROR 12.90 [10.62–15.66], IC 2.76 [2.52–3.01], middle signal) and platinum-based therapy (ROR 15.11 [12.43–18.37], IC 2.91 [2.66–3.15], middle signal) in the FAERS database. A significant association was detected between EV and all the cutaneous adverse effects (AEs) except erythema, palmar–plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, and dermatitis allergic. Both Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis occurred 15 times as frequently for EV compared with all other drugs (ROR = 15.20; ROR = 15.52), while Stevens–Johnson syndrome occurred 18 times and toxic epidermal necrolysis occurred 7 times as frequently for EV compared with platinum-based therapy in the database (ROR = 18.74; ROR = 7.80). All groups that limited the gender and age showed a significant association between EV and cutaneous toxicities. Conclusions: A significant signal was detected between EV use and cutaneous toxicities. It is worth noting that Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis were significantly associated with EV use.

Methods: This retrospective analysis was conducted in 1,063 cancer patients who received ICIs between 2011 and 2017. We identified irAEs by manual review of medical records to determine the incidence of each of our endpoints, namely colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, other irAE, or no irAE. We then performed a secondary analysis utilizing ICD claims data alone using a broad range of symptom and disease-specific ICD codes representative of irAEs. Results: 16% (n = 174/1,063) of the total study population was initially found to have either pneumonitis 3% (n = 37), colitis 7% (n = 81) or hepatitis 5% (n = 56) on manual review. Of these patients, 46% (n = 80/174) did not have ICD code evidence in the EHR reflecting their irAE. Of the total patients not found to have any irAEs during manual review, 61% (n = 459/748) of patients had ICD codes suggestive of possible irAE, yet were not identified as having an irAE during manual review.

This study was designed to investigate the incidence rate of—and risk for—myocarditis and pericarditis following COVID-19 vaccination in the United States according to age and vaccine type. This study used the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) from 11 December 2020 to 13 August 2021. A population-based data mining approach was performed based on the reporting odds ratio (ROR). Adverse events of myocarditis and pericarditis following COVID-19 vaccination were rare, with an incidence rate of 5.98 (95% CI = 5.73–6.24) cases per million doses administered. The incidence rate was higher in adolescents and after the administration of the second dose of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines. Overall, two mRNA vaccines were significantly associated with increased risks for myocarditis/pericarditis (mRNA-1273 (Moderna): ROR = 2.91, 95% CI = 2.21–3.83; BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech): ROR = 5.37, 95% CI = 4.10–7.04) compared to all other vaccines from VAERS. The viral vector vaccine of Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen) was not associated with signals of myocarditis/pericarditis (ROR = 1.39; 95% CI = 0.99–1.97). This study found increased risks for myocarditis/pericarditis following mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. For patients at high risk for myocarditis/pericarditis or with myocardial injuries, the viral vector vaccine may be an alternative for consideration. © 2021 by the authors.

This study aimed to analyze the effect of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) on the risk of readmission for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with anemia. Methods. In this study, 893 hospitalized RA patients were followed up by telephone. A retrospective cohort study was conducted using propensity score matching (PSM). The Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the influence of various factors on the risk of readmission for RA patients with anemia. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve was utilized to analyze the effect of TCM intervention time on readmission. Results. The incidence of anemia was 58.08% (471/811) in RA patients. After 1: 1 PSM, 328 RA patients with anemia and 328 RA patients without anemia were finally included in our study. The readmission rate of anemia patients was higher than that of patients without anemia (P<0.01). The readmission rate of RA patients with anemia was obviously lower in the TCM group than in the non-TCM group (P<0.01). The Cox proportional hazards model showed TCM as an independent protective factor as it decreased the risk of readmission by 50% (HR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.27-0.94, P=0.03) in RA patients with anemia. In addition, the risk of readmission was dramatically diminished in the high-exposure subgroup (TCM > 12 months) compared with the low-exposure subgroup (TCM ≤ 12 months) (log-rank P=0.016). Conclusion. TCM, as a protective factor, is associated with a reduced risk of readmission in RA patients with anemia.  © 2022 Yanqiu Sun et al.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: J.

However, chronic use is associated with different adverse effects like anxiety, euphoria, nervousness, insomnia, depression, and agitation. In this study, we assessed the outcome behind the restriction on dispensing Tramadol in private health sectors in Iraq. Methods: We look at tramadol data from VigiBase data searches and the Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSR) that are formally supported by the WHO worldwide database. All complaints were evaluated using Vigilyze data mining and computing IC25 to assess the strength of the link between Tramadol and the adverse reactions it causes, as well as to compare them to other records from around the world. Results: For patients who used tramadol in a variety of dose forms, 184 instances were gathered over the course of seven years by the Iraqi Pharmacovigilance Center. There were 32 cases of hyperhidrosis, which occurred when tramadol was used alone, 47 incidents of vomiting, and 67 cases of nausea. Many adverse effects, including chest pain, hyperhidrosis, headache, dyspnea, and constipation, are more common in Iraqi records than in internationally known instances. Other side effects, such as vomiting, hallucination, vertigo, respiratory depression, and chills, were found to be milder than previously reported. There were no deaths in any of the instances that were recorded during this time period. Conclusion: The number of reported tramadol-induced adverse events has fallen significantly, which can be attributed to the ministry of health restricting tramadol dispensing and enabling public hospitals to only dispense it under medical monitoring. © 2022 The Author(s).","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: S.S.

We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the toxicity profile in advanced lung cancer using multi-source medical data. Methods: First, we systematically searched the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases (from inception to 10 August 2021) for relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving ICI-based treatments for advanced lung cancer. The primary outcomes were treatment-related AEs and irAEs, including events that were assigned grade 1–5 and 3–5. The secondary outcomes were grade 5 AEs and irAEs (grade 1–5 and grade 3–5) in specific organs. Network comparisons were conducted for 11 treatments, including chemotherapy (CT), ICI monotherapy (three regimens: programmed death-1 receptor [PD-1] inhibitors, programmed death ligand-1 [PD-L1] inhibitors, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen [CTLA-4] inhibitors), dual-ICI combination therapy (two regimens), and treatment using one or two ICI drugs administered in combination with CT (five regimens). We also conducted a disproportionality analysis by extracting reports of various irAEs associated with ICIs from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. The reporting odds ratios and fatality proportions of different irAEs were calculated and compared. PROSPERO: CRD42021268650. Findings: Overall, 41 RCTs involving 23,121 patients with advanced lung cancer were included. Treatments containing chemotherapy increased the risk of treatment-related AEs compared to ICI-based regimens without chemotherapy. Concerning irAEs, PD-L1 + CTLA-4 + CT was associated with the highest risk of grade 1–5 irAEs, followed by two regimens of dual ICI combination, three regimens of ICI monotherapy, and three regimens of one ICI combined with CT. For 3–5 irAEs, CTLA-4 accounted for most AEs. Detailed comparisons of ICI-based treatment options provided irAE profiles based on specific organs/systems and AE severity. Insights from the FAERS database revealed that signals corresponding to pneumonitis, colitis, thyroiditis, and hypophysitis were observed across all ICI regimens. Further analyses of the outcomes indicated that myocarditis (163 of 367, 44.4%), pneumonitis (1610 of 4497, 35.8%), and hepatitis (290 of 931, 31.1%) had high fatality rates. Interpretation: Included RCTs showed heterogeneity in a few clinical factors, and reports derived from the FAERS database might have involved inaccurate data. Our results can be used as a basis for improving clinical treatment strategies and designing preventive methods for ICI treatment in advanced lung cancer.

We applied a novel data mining tool to detect potential adverse events of canagliflozin, the first sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2 inhibitor) in the United States, using real-world data from shortly after its market entry and before public awareness of its potential safety concerns. Methods: In a U. S. commercial claims dataset (29 March 2013–30 Sept 2015), two pairwise cohorts of patients over 18 years of age with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who were newly dispensed canagliflozin or an active comparator, that is a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor (DPP4) or a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP1), were identified and propensity score-matched. We used variable ratio matching with up to four people receiving a DPP4 or GLP1 for each person receiving canagliflozin. We identified potential safety signals using a hierarchical tree-based scan statistic data mining method with the hierarchical outcome tree constructed based on international classification of disease coding. We screened for incident adverse events where there were more outcomes observed among canagliflozin vs. comparator initiators than expected by chance, after adjusting for multiple testing. Results: We identified two pairwise propensity score variable ratio matched cohorts of 44,733 canagliflozin vs. 99,458 DPP4 initiators, and 55,974 canagliflozin vs. 74,727 GLP1 initiators. When we screened inpatient and emergency room diagnoses, diabetic ketoacidosis was the only severe adverse event associated with canagliflozin initiation with p <.05 in both cohorts. When outpatient diagnoses were also considered, signals for female and male genital infections emerged in both cohorts (p <.05). Conclusions and relevance: In a large population-based study, we identified known but no other adverse events associated with canagliflozin, providing reassurance on its safety among adult patients with T2D and suggesting the tree-based scan statistic method is a useful post-marketing safety monitoring tool for newly approved medications. © 2021 The Authors.

A data-mining method not requiring prespecification of health outcome(s) or postexposure period(s) of potentially increased risk can be used to identify possible associations between an exposure and any of thousands of medically attended health outcomes; this method was applied to data on the 9-valent HPV vaccine (HPV9) to detect potential safety problems. Data on 9- to 26-year-olds who had received HPV9 vaccine between November 4, 2016, and August 5, 2018, inclusive, were extracted from the MarketScan database and analyzed for statistically significant clustering of incident diagnoses within the hierarchy of diagnoses coded using the International Classification of Diseases and temporally within the 1 year after vaccination, using the self-controlled tree-temporal scan statistic and TreeScan software. Only 56 days of postvaccination enrollment was required; subsequent follow-up was censored at disenrollment. Multiple testing was adjusted for. The analysis included 493,089 doses of HPV9. Almost all signals resulted from temporal confounding, not unexpected with a 1-year follow-up period. The only plausible signals were for nonspecific adverse events (e.g., injection-site reactions, headache) on days 1-2 after vaccination, with attributable risks as low as 1 per 100,000 vaccinees. Considering the broad scope of the evaluation and the high statistical power, the findings of no specific serious adverse events should provide reassurance about this vaccine's safety.  © 2021 The Author(s).","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 17; Correspondence Address: W.K.

FN can be prevented with granulocyte-colony stimulating factors (G-CSFs). Guidelines recommend primary G-CSF use for patients receiving either high (> 20%) FN risk (HR) chemotherapy, or intermediate (10–20%) FN risk (IR) chemotherapy if the overall risk with additional patient-related risk factors exceeds 20%. In this study, we applied an EHR text-mining tool for real-world G-CSF treatment evaluation in breast cancer patients. Methods: Breast cancer patients receiving IR or HR chemotherapy treatments between January 2015 and February 2021 at LUMC, the Netherlands, were included. We retrospectively collected data from EHR with a text-mining tool and assessed G-CSF use, risk factors, and the FN and neutropenia (grades 3–4) and incidence. Results: A total of 190 female patients were included, who received 77 HR and 113 IR treatments. In 88.3% of the HR regimens, G-CSF was administered; 7.3% of these patients developed FN vs. 33.3% without G-CSF. Although most IR regimen patients had ≥ 2 risk factors, only 4% received G-CSF, of which none developed neutropenia. However, without G-CSF, 11.9% developed FN and 31.2% severe neutropenia. Conclusions: Our text-mining study shows high G-CSF use among HR regimen patients, and low use among IR regimen patients, although most had ≥ 2 risk factors. Therefore, current practice is not completely in accordance with the guidelines. This shows the need for increased awareness and clarity regarding risk factors. Also, text-mining can effectively be implemented for the evaluation of patient care. © 2022, The Author(s).","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: J.

Recent efforts such as Generalized Read-Across (GenRA) facilitate automated read-across predictions for untested chemicals. GenRA makes predictions of toxicity outcomes based on “neighboring” chemicals characterized by chemical and bioactivity fingerprints. Here we investigated the impact of biological similarities on neighborhood formation and read-across performance in predicting hazard (based on repeat-dose testing outcomes from US EPA ToxRefDB v2.0). We used targeted transcriptomic data on 93 genes for 1060 chemicals in HepaRG™ cells that measure nuclear receptor activation, xenobiotic metabolism, cellular stress, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis. Transcriptomic similarity between chemicals was calculated using binary hit-calls from concentration-response data for each gene. We evaluated GenRA performance in predicting ToxRefDB v2.0 hazard outcomes using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for the baseline approach (chemical fingerprints) versus transcriptomic fingerprints and a combination of both (hybrid). For all endpoints, there were significant but only modest improvements in ROC AUC scores of 0.01 (2.1%) and 0.04 (7.3%) with transcriptomic and hybrid descriptors, respectively. However, for liver-specific toxicity endpoints, ROC AUC scores improved by 10% and 17% for transcriptomic and hybrid descriptors, respectively. Our findings suggest that using hybrid descriptors formed by combining chemical and targeted transcriptomic information can improve in vivo toxicity predictions in the right context. © 2021","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 16; Correspondence Address: I.

Methods: Disproportionality and Bayesian analysis were used in data mining to screen the suspected renal adverse effects after the administration of different ICIs, based on FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from January 2004 to September 2019. The time to onset, fatality and hospitalization rates of renal adverse effects were also investigated. Results: We identified 1444 reports of renal adverse effects. Affected patients tended to be older than 65 years (52.7%). Renal effects were most commonly reported in nivolumab monotherapy (33.24%). Atezolizumab appeared the strongest association among six ICI monotherapies, based on the highest reporting odds ratio (ROR = 144.38, two-sided 95% CI = 123.08 −169.37), proportional reporting ratio (PRR = 139.13, χ2 = 21 425.38), and empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM = 131.75, one-sided 95% CI = 115.28). The combination treatments showed higher RORs, PRRs, and EBGMs, compared with either nivolumab or pembrolizumab monotherapy. The median onset time of renal adverse effects was 48 (interquartile range [IQR] 18.75-121.25) days after the monotherapies of ICI regimens. Patients treated with the combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab were younger than receivers in nivolumab monotherapy (63.81 ± 12.03 vs 66.39 ± 11.53, P =.004); The fatality rate of renal adverse effects appeared lower in the combination group, compared to nivolumab monotherapy (18.53% vs 27.50%, P =.004). The top hospitalization rates due to renal effects occurred in patients with combination therapies. Conclusion: Based on the FAERS database, we profiled renal adverse effects after various ICIs with real-world data in occurrences, clinical characteristics, and prognosis. Renal effects should be tightly monitored, especially within the first several months after ICIs administration. Particular concern should be paid for patients with a tendency for kidney impairments, such as old age. © 2020 The Authors.

Concretely, the aims of this research were to build a joint population pharmacokinetic model for capecitabine and three of its metabolites (5-DFUR, 5-FU and 5-FUH2) and to determine optimal sampling times for therapeutic drug monitoring. Methods: We used data of 7 treatment cycles of capecitabine in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The population pharmacokinetic model was built as a multicompartmental model using NONMEM and was internally validated by visual predictive check. Optimal sampling times were estimated using PFIM 4.0 following D-optimality criterion. Results: The final model was a multicompartmental model which represented the sequential transformations from capecitabine to its metabolites 5-DFUR, 5-FU and 5-FUH2 and was correctly validated. The optimal sampling times were 0.546, 0.892, 1.562, 4.736 and 8 hours after the administration of the drug. For its correct implementation in clinical practice, the values were rounded to 0.5, 1, 1.5, 5 and 8 hours after the administration of the drug. Conclusions: Capecitabine, 5-DFUR, 5-FU and 5-FUH2 can be correctly described by the joint multicompartmental model presented in this work. The aforementioned times are optimal to maximize the information of samples.

The limited understanding of the mechanisms driving these illnesses with the slow pace and high cost of drug development exacerbates this issue. For these reasons, drug repurposing – both a less expensive and time-efficient practice compared to de novo drug development – has been a promising strategy to overcome the paucity of treatments available for these debilitating disorders. While empirical drug-repurposing has been a routine practice in clinical psychiatry, innovative, informed, and cost-effective repurposing efforts using big data (“omics”) have been designed to characterize drugs by structural and transcriptomic signatures. These strategies, in conjunction with ontological integration, provide an important opportunity to address knowledge-based challenges associated with drug development for CNS disorders. In this review, we discuss various signature-based in silico approaches to drug repurposing, its integration with multiple omics platforms, and how this data can be used for clinically relevant, evidence-based drug repurposing. These tools provide an exciting translational avenue to merge omics-based drug discovery platforms with patient-specific disease signatures, ultimately facilitating the identification of new therapies for numerous psychiatric disorders. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 46; Correspondence Address: R.

Meanwhile, biomedical experts have built many highly-structured knowledge bases (KBs), which contain prior knowledge about chemicals and diseases. Prior knowledge provides strong support for CDR extraction. How to make full use of it is worth studying. Results: This paper proposes a novel model called ""Knowledge-guided Convolutional Networks (KCN)"" to leverage prior knowledge for CDR extraction. The proposed model first learns knowledge representations including entity embeddings and relation embeddings from KBs. Then, entity embeddings are used to control the propagation of context features towards a chemical-disease pair with gated convolutions. After that, relation embeddings are employed to further capture the weighted context features by a shared attention pooling. Finally, the weighted context features containing additional knowledge information are used for CDR extraction. Experiments on the BioCreative V CDR dataset show that the proposed KCN achieves 71.28% F1-score, which outperforms most of the state-of-the-art systems. Conclusions: This paper proposes a novel CDR extraction model KCN to make full use of prior knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that KCN could effectively integrate prior knowledge and contexts for the performance improvement. © 2019 The Author(s).","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 27; Correspondence Address: H.

Another extension for FDs allows one to represent approximate functional dependencies (AFDs), as “patients with the same symptomsgenerallyundergo the same medical tests.” It enables data to deviate from the defined constraints according to a user-defined percentage. Approximate temporal functional dependencies (ATFDs) merge the concepts of temporal functional dependency and of approximate functional dependency. Among the different kinds of ATFD, the Approximate Pure Temporally Evolving Functional Dependencies (APE-FDs for short) allow one to detect patterns on the evolution of data in the database and to discover dependencies as “For most patients with the same initial diagnosis, the same medical test is prescribed after the occurrence of same symptom.” Mining ATFDs from large databases may be computationally expensive. In this paper, we focus on APE-FDs and prove that, unfortunately, verifying a single APE-FD over a given database instance is in general NP-complete. In order to cope with this problem, we propose a framework for mining complex APE-FDs in real-world data collections. In the framework, we designed and applied sound and advanced model-checking techniques.

Our empirical evaluation is applied to a wide array of benchmark data sets and fourteen novel datasets for adverse drug event detection. We demonstrate how the introduction of simple sequential features, followed by progressively more complex features each improve classification performance. Importantly, this investigation demonstrates that SMILE significantly improves AUC performance over the current state-of-the-art. The investigation also reveals that the selection of underlying classification algorithm is important to achieve superior predictive performance, and how the number of features influences the performance of our framework. © 2020, The Author(s).","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 9; Correspondence Address: J.

In silico strategies to classify synergistic vs. antagonistic drug pairs is more efficient than experimental strategies. However, most of the developed methods have been applied only to cancer therapies. In this study, we introduce a novel method, XGBoost, based on five features of drugs and biomolecular networks of their targets, to classify synergistic vs. antagonistic drug combinations from different drug categories. We found that XGBoost outperformed other classifiers in both stratified fivefold cross-validation (CV) and independent validation. For example, XGBoost achieved higher predictive accuracy than other models (0.86, 0.78, 0.78, and 0.83 for XGBoost, logistic regression, naïve Bayesian, and random forest, respectively) for an independent validation set. We also found that the five-feature XGBoost model is much more effective at predicting combinatorial therapies that have synergistic effects than those with antagonistic effects. The five-feature XGBoost model was also validated on TCGA data with accuracy of 0.79 among the 61 tested drug pairs, which is comparable to that of DeepSynergy. Among the 14 main anatomical/pharmacological groups classified according to WHO Anatomic Therapeutic Class, for drugs belonging to five groups, their prediction accuracy was significantly increased (odds ratio < 1) or reduced (odds ratio > 1) (Fisher's exact test, p < 0.05). This study concludes that our five-feature XGBoost model has significant benefits for classifying synergistic vs. antagonistic drug combinations. © 2019 Ji, Tong, Liu and Shi.

To increase the safety of new drugs, there is a need to better understand the mechanisms causing the adverse events. One way to derive new mechanistic hypotheses is by linking data on drug adverse events with the drugs' biological targets. In this study, we have used data mining techniques and mutual information statistical approaches to find associations between reported adverse events collected from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System and assay outcomes from ToxCast, with the aim to generate mechanistic hypotheses related to structural cardiotoxicity (morphological damage to cardiomyocytes and/or loss of viability). Our workflow identified 22 adverse event-assay outcome associations. From these associations, 10 implicated targets could be substantiated with evidence from previous studies reported in the literature.

In this study, similarity searching based on molecular 2D fingerprint was performed to analyze off-target effects of drugs. The purpose of this study is to determine the correlation between the adverse effects and drug off-targets. Methods: A workflow was built using KNIME to run dataset preparation of twenty-nine targets from ChEMBL, generate molecular 2D fingerprints of the ligands, calculate the similarity between ligand sets, and compute the statistical significance using similarity ensemble approach (SEA). Tanimoto coefficients (Tc) are used as a measure of chemical similarity in which the values between 0.2 and 0.4 are the most common for the majority of ligand pairs and considered to be insignificant similar. Result: The majority of ligand sets are unrelated, as is evidenced by the intrinsic chemical differences and the classification of statistical significance based on expectation value. The rank-ordered expectation value of inter-target similarity showed a correlation with off-target effects of the known drugs. Conclusion: Similarity-searching using molecular 2D fingerprint can be applied to predict off-targets and correlate them to the adverse effects of the drugs.

This targeted, α‐particle‐emitting therapy has demonstrated significant survival benefit accompanied by a favorable safety profile. Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that its combined use with abiraterone and prednisone/prednisolone may be associated with increased risk of death and fractures. While the precise pathophysiologic mechanisms of these events are not yet clear, collecting evidence from more clinical trials and translational studies is necessary. The aim of our present study is to assess whether accessible sources of patient outcome data can help gain additional clinical insights to radium‐223 dichlorideʹs safety profile. Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of cases extracted from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System and characterized side effect occurrence by using reporting ratios. Results: A total of ~1500 prostate cancer patients treated with radium‐223 dichloride was identified, and side effects reported with the use of radium‐223 dichloride alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents were extracted. Our analysis demonstrates that radium‐ 223 dichloride may often come with hematological‐related reactions, and that, when administered together with other drugs, its safety profile may differ. Conclusions: While more prospective studies are needed to fully characterize the toxicological profile of radium‐223 dichloride, the present work constitutes perhaps the first effort to examine its safety when administered alone and in combination with other agents based on computational evidence from public real‐world post marketing data. © 2019 by the authors.

While medical evidence is being generated, social media surveillance offers a fast and inexpensive alternative to traditional surveys in ascertaining perceived therapeutic purposes and modes of consumption for CBD products. Methods: We collected all comments from the CBD subreddit posted between January 1 and April 30, 2019 as well as comments submitted to the FDA regarding regulation of cannabis-derived products and analyzed them using a rule-based language processing method. A relative ranking of popular therapeutic uses and product groups for CBD is obtained based on frequency of pattern matches including precise queries that entail identifying mentions of the condition, a CBD product, and some “trigger” phrase indicating therapeutic use. We validated the social media-based findings using a similar analysis on comments to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) 2019 request-for-comments on cannabis-derived products. Results: CBD is mostly discussed as a remedy for anxiety disorders and pain and this is consistent across both comment sources. Of comments posted to the CBD subreddit during the monitored time span, 6.19% mentioned anxiety at least once with at least 6.02% of these comments specifically mentioning CBD as a treatment for anxiety (i.e., 0.37% of total comments). The most popular CBD product group is oil and tinctures. Conclusion: Social media surveillance of CBD usage has the potential to surface new therapeutic use-cases as they are posted. Contemporary social media data indicate, for example, that stress and nausea are frequently mentioned as therapeutic use cases for CBD without corresponding evidence, that affirms or denies, in the research literature. However, the abundance of anecdotal claims warrants serious scientific exploration moving forward. Meanwhile, as FDA ponders regulation, our effort demonstrates that social data offers a convenient affordance to surveil for CBD usage patterns in a way that is fast and inexpensive and can inform conventional electronic surveys. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 26; Correspondence Address: R.

Such databases are frequently configured as distributed networks. That is, patient-level data are kept behind firewalls and not communicated outside of the data vendor other than in aggregate form. Instead, data are standardized across the network, and queries of the network are executed locally by data partners, and summary results provided to a central research partner(s) for amalgamation, aggregation, and summarization. Such networks can be huge covering years of data on upwards of 100 million patients. Examples of such networks include the FDA Sentinel Network, ASPEN, CNODES, and EU-ADR. As this is a new emerging field, we note in this paper the conceptual similarities and differences between the analysis of distributed networks and the now well-established field of meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs).

We analysed reports to the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) of adverse events (AE) following bivalent HPV vaccine (2vHPV). Methods: We conducted descriptive analysis of 2vHPV reports, reviewed individual reports, calculated crude AE reporting rates and conducted empirical Bayesian data mining. Results: Of 241 2vHPV reports, 158 were in females, 64 in males (2vHPV is approved for females only) and 19 with unknown sex; 95.8% were classified as nonserious. Dizziness, headache, nausea and injection site reactions were the most common symptoms. Crude AE reporting rates were 33.3 reports per 100 000 doses distributed overall, and 1.4 per 100 000 for serious reports. Empirical Bayesian data mining identified disproportional reporting for three types of medical errors; assessment indicated findings that were probably driven by inadvertent 2vHPV use in males.

The availability of biomedical databases and online health-related information, as well as the high-performance computing, empowers the development of computational drug repositioning methods. In this work, we developed a systematic approach that identifies repositioning drugs based on heterogeneous network mining using both pharmaceutical databases (PharmGKB and SIDER) and online health community (MedHelp). By utilizing adverse drug reactions (ADRs) as the intermediate, we constructed a heterogeneous health network containing drugs, diseases, and ADRs, and developed path-based heterogeneous network mining approaches for drug repositioning. Additionally, we investigated on how the data sources affect the performance on drug repositioning. Experiment results showed that combining both PharmKGB and MedHelp identified 479 repositioning drugs, which are more than the repositioning drugs discovered by other alternatives.

There is a growing demand for computational methods to efficiently and effectively analyse large-scale data to detect signals of Adverse Drug-drug Interactions (ADDIs). In this paper, we aim to detect high-quality signals of ADDIs which are non-spurious and non-redundant. We propose a new method which employs the framework of Bayesian network to infer the direct associations between the target ADE and medicines, and uses domain knowledge to facilitate the learning of Bayesian network structures. To improve efficiency and avoid redundancy, we design a level-wise algorithm with pruning strategy to search for high-quality ADDI signals. We have applied the proposed method to the United States Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) data. The result shows that 54.45% of detected signals are verified as known DDIs and 10.89% were evaluated as high-quality ADDI signals, demonstrating that the proposed method could be a promising tool for ADDI signal detection. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 11; Correspondence Address: C.

Furthermore, it is unknown whether healthcare professionals consider the inactive ingredient portion when prescribing medications to patients. Methods: We used data mining to track the number of available formulations for the same medication over time and correlate the number of available versions in 2019 to the number of manufacturers, the years since first approval, and the number of prescriptions. A focused survey among healthcare professionals was conducted to query their consideration of the inactive ingredient portion of a medication when writing prescriptions. Results: The number of available versions of a single medication have dramatically increased in the last 40 years. The number of available, different versions of medications are largely determined by the number of manufacturers producing this medication.

Despite the remarkable effectiveness of the HPV vaccines, there have been many complaints about their risk–benefit profile due to adverse events following immunization (AEFI). The purpose of this study is to analyse the safety profile of the HPV vaccine basing on real-life data derived from reports of suspected AEFIs collected in the US Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) and assess if the searches on Google overlap with spontaneous reporting. Methods: We collected all the reports in VAERS between January 2007 to December 2017 related to the HPV vaccines. A disproportionality analysis using reporting odds ratio (ROR) with 95% confidence interval was performed. Results: Over the 10-year period, 55 356 reports of AEFI related to HPV vaccines were retrieved in VAERS, corresponding to 224 863 vaccine-event pairs. The highest number of reports was related to Gardasil (n = 42 244). The two events more frequently reported and statistically significant for HPV vaccines were dizziness (n = 6259; ROR = 2.60; 95% confidence interval 2.53–2.66) and syncope (n = 6004; ROR = 6.28; 95% confidence interval 6.12–6.44). The trends of spontaneous reporting and Google searches overlap. Conclusion: The AEFI analysis showed that the events most frequently reported were non-serious and listed in the corresponding summary of product characteristics. Potential safety signals arose regarding less frequent AEFIs that would deserve further investigation.

Results: We put forward a differential geometry-based geometric learning (DG-GL) hypothesis that the intrinsic physics of three-dimensional (3D) molecular structures lies on a family of low-dimensional manifolds embedded in a high-dimensional data space. We encode crucial chemical, physical, and biological information into 2D element interactive manifolds, extracted from a high-dimensional structural data space via a multiscale discrete-to-continuum mapping using differentiable density estimators. Differential geometry apparatuses are utilized to construct element interactive curvatures in analytical forms for certain analytically differentiable density estimators. These low-dimensional differential geometry representations are paired with a robust machine learning algorithm to showcase their descriptive and predictive powers for large, diverse, and complex molecular and biomolecular datasets. Extensive numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed DG-GL strategy outperforms other advanced methods in the predictions of drug discovery-related protein-ligand binding affinity, drug toxicity, and molecular solvation free energy.

We examined whether case‐only analyses from spontaneous reporting systems can detect host‐medication interactions in oral antidiabetic drug‐associated myocardial infarction. Methods and Results Interaction between sex and use of oral antidiabetic drugs was mined among patients with myocardial infarction in the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System from 2004 to 2014, including 55 718 males and 42 428 females. The odds ratio (OR) of multiplicative interactions was used to estimate sex‐drug interaction. Detected signs of these interactions were then validated by a nested case‐control study utilizing a healthcare record database, Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, from 2001 to 2014, including 31 585 cases and 126 340 controls. In the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System, a higher proportion of male than female patients used metformin (10.32% in males versus 7.82% in females) and sulfonylureas (4.75% in males versus 3.43% in females); after adjusting for patients’ pharmacy‐based chronic disease score, males had a higher risk of metformin‐associated (OR=1.07; 99% confidence interval, 1.00–1.14) and sulfonylureas‐associated (OR=1.21; 99% confidence interval, 1.10–1.33) myocardial infarction than females. Detected signs of sex‐drug interactions were validated in the National Health Insurance Research Database (OR for metformin=1.14; 99% confidence interval, 1.03–1.26; OR for sulfonylureas=1.13; 99% confidence interval, 1.02–1.25). Conclusions Males have a higher risk of metformin‐ and sulfonylureas‐associated myocardial infarction than females, which suggests that sex‐drug interactions are a key issue in diabetes mellitus treatment plan development.

To provide an updated general safety assessment, we reviewed reports of AEs following MenACWY-D submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Methods: VAERS is a national spontaneous reporting vaccine safety surveillance system co-administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. We searched the VAERS database for U.S. reports of AEs after administration of MenACWY-D from January 2005 through June 2016. We conducted clinical reviews of serious reports after MenACWY-D administered alone, reports of MenACWY-D use during pregnancy, and reports of selected pre-specified outcomes. We screened for disproportionate reporting of AEs after MenACWY-D using empirical Bayesian data mining. Results: VAERS received 13,075 U.S. reports after receipt of MenACWY-D; most (86%) described vaccination in adolescents, were classified as non-serious (94%), and described AEs consistent with pre-licensure studies. We did not find any evidence that reported deaths were related to vaccination. In serious reports, GBS and meningococcal infection were the most commonly reported medical conditions. Many reports of MenACWY-D use during pregnancy described inadvertent vaccination; most (61%) did not report any AE. Conclusions: Findings from our comprehensive review of reports to VAERS following MenACWY-D are consistent with data from pre-licensure studies and provide further reassurance on the safety of MenACWY-D. © 2020","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 11; Correspondence Address: T.R.

However, treatment with these immunotherapeutic agents is frequently associated with increased risk of toxicity, and (auto-) immune-related adverse events. The precise pathophysiologic mechanisms of these events are not yet clear, and evidence from clinical trials and translational studies remains limited. Our retrospective analysis of ~7700 metastatic melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab and/or nivolumab from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) demonstrates that the identified immune-related reactions are specific to ipilimumab and/or nivolumab, and that when the two agents are administered together, their safety profile combines reactions from each drug alone. While more prospective studies are needed to characterize the safety of ipilimumab and nivolumab, the present work constitutes perhaps the first effort to examine the safety of these drugs and their combination based on computational evidence from real world post marketing data. © 2018 by the authors.

However, pediatric-specific safety evidence is scarce. The aim of this study was to screen for signals of previously unknown adverse events of TNF-α inhibitors in pediatric patients. Methods: We conducted a data-mining study based on routinely collected, nationwide Danish healthcare data for 2004–2016. Using tree-based scan statistics to identify events with unexpectedly high incidence during TNF-α inhibitor use among patients with inflammatory bowel disease or juvenile idiopathic arthritis, two analyses were performed: comparison with episodes of no use and with other time periods from the same patient. Based on incident physician-assigned diagnosis codes from outpatient and inpatient visits in specialist care, we screened thousands of potential adverse events while adjusting for multiple testing. Results: We identified 1310 episodes of new TNF-α inhibitor use that met the eligibility criteria. Two signals of adverse events of TNF-α inhibitors, as compared with no use, were detected. First, there were excess events of dermatologic complications (ICD-10: L00-L99, 87 vs. 44 events, risk difference [RD] 3.3%), which have been described previously in adults and children. Second, there were excess events of psychiatric diagnosis adjustment disorders (ICD-10: F432, 33 vs. 7 events, RD 2.0%), which was likely associated with the underlying disease and its severity, rather than with the treatment. The self-controlled analysis generated no signal. Conclusions: No signals of previously unknown adverse events of TNF-α inhibitors in pediatric patients were detected. The study showed that real-world data and newly developed methods for adverse events data mining can play a particularly important role in pediatrics where pre-approval drug safety data are scarce. © 2020, The Author(s).","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 8; Correspondence Address: V.

Understanding the true voice of consumers by analyzing such a large amount of user-generated content is of great significance to pharmaceutical manufacturers and e-commerce websites. The aim of this paper is to automatically extract hidden topics from web-based drug reviews using the structural topic model (STM) to examine consumers’ concerns when they buy drugs online. The STM is a probabilistic extension of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which allows the consolidation of document-level covariates. This innovation allows us to capture consumer dissatisfaction along with their dynamics over time. We extract 12 topics, and five of them are negative topics representing consumer dissatisfaction, whose appearances in the negative reviews are substantially higher than those in the positive reviews. We also come to the conclusion that the prevalence of these five negative topics has not decreased over time. Furthermore, our results reveal that the prevalence of price-related topics has decreased significantly in positive reviews, which indicates that low-price strategies are becoming less attractive to customers. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first study using STM to analyze the unstructured textual data of drug reviews, which enhances the understanding of the aspects of drug consumer concerns and contributes to the research of pharmaceutical e-commerce literature. © 2020 by the authors.

Materials and Methods: We analyzed the percentages of AEs according to vaccine type [pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines (PPSVs) and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs)] in children and adults using data from the Korea Adverse Event Reporting System (KAERS) database from 2005 to 2016. A signal was defined as an AE that met all three indices of data mining: proportional reporting ratio (PRR), reporting odds ratio (ROR), and information component (IC). We validated the detected signals by calculating sensitivity, specificity, as well as positive and negative predictive values of the signals against label information. Results: Of the 39933 AE reports on vaccination, 5718 (7.0%) were related to pneumococcal vaccine. The most frequent AE after vaccination with PPSV was fever (23.9%) in children and injection-site reaction in adults. The most frequent AE after vaccination with PCV in children was pharyngitis (26.2%). In total, 13 AEs met all three indices for signal detection. Among these, hypotension, apathy, sepsis, and increased serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase level were not listed on vaccine labels. In validation analysis, PRR and ROR performed slightly better than IC for adults who were vaccinated with PPSVs. Conclusion: Overall, 13 new signals of PPSVs, including four signals not listed on the labels, were detected.

We assessed the safety of second-dose varicella vaccination. METHODS: We identified second-dose single-antigen varicella vaccine reports in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System during 2006 to 2014 among children aged 4 to 18 years. We analyzed reports by age group (4-6 and 7-18 years), sex, serious or nonserious status, most common adverse events (AEs), and whether other vaccines were administered concomitantly with varicella vaccine. We reviewed serious reports of selected AEs and conducted empirical Bayesian data mining to detect disproportional reporting of AEs. RESULTS: We identified 14 641 Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System reports after second-dose varicella vaccination, with 494 (3%) classified as serious. Among nonserious reports, injection site reactions were most common (48% of children aged 4-6 years, 38% of children aged 7-18 years). The most common AEs among serious reports were pyrexia (31%) for children aged 4 to 6 years and headache (28%) and vomiting (27%) for children aged 7 to 18 years. Serious reports of selected AEs included anaphylaxis (83), meningitis (5), encephalitis (16), cellulitis (52), varicella (6), herpes zoster (6), and deaths (7). One immunosuppressed adolescent was reported with vaccine-strain herpes zoster. Only previously known AEs were reported more frequently after seconddose varicella vaccination compared with other vaccines. CONCLUSIONS: We identified no new or unexpected safety concerns for second-dose varicella vaccination.

Taking advantage of their favourable properties can potentially allow the safer use of drugs that are considered highly toxic. A means for vehicle selection without experimental trial would therefore be of benefit in saving time and money for the industry. Although machine learning is increasingly used in predictive toxicology, to our knowledge there is no reported work in using machine learning techniques to model drug-vehicle relationships for vehicle selection to minimise toxicity. In this paper we demonstrate the use of data mining and machine learning techniques to process, extract and build models based on classifiers (decision trees and random forests) that allow us to predict which vehicle would be most suited to reduce a drug’s toxicity. Using data acquired from the National Institute of Health’s (NIH) Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) we propose a methodology using an area under a curve (AUC) approach that allows us to distinguish which vehicle provides the best toxicity profile for a drug and build classification models based on this knowledge. Our results show that we can achieve prediction accuracies of 80 % using random forest models whilst the decision tree models produce accuracies in the 70 % region. We consider our methodology widely applicable within the scientific domain and beyond for comprehensively building classification models for the comparison of functional relationships between two variables. © 2015, The Author(s).","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 41; Correspondence Address: P.

For this purpose, serum chemokine/cytokine levels were measured by cytometric-bead-array in HCV patients, categorized according to immunotherapy response as: non-responder/NR, relapser/REL and sustained-virologic-responder/SVR. The results demonstrated an overall increase of serum chemokine/cytokine levels in HCV patients. In general, therapeutic failure was associated with presence of a predominant baseline proinflammatory pattern with enhanced CCL5/RANTES, IFN-α, IFN-γ along with decreased IL-10 levels in NR and increased IL-6 and TNF in REL. SVR displayed lower baseline proinflammatory status with decreased CXCL8/IL-8, IL-12 and IL-17 levels. The inability to uphold IFN-α levels during immunotherapy was characteristic of NR. Serum chemokine/cytokine signatures further support the deleterious effect of proinflammatory baseline status and the critical role of increased/persistent IFN-α levels to guarantee the sustained virologic response. The prominent baseline proinflammatory milieu observed in NR and REL yielded a restricted biomarker network with small number of neighborhood connections, whereas SVR displayed a network with integrated cytokine connectivity. Noteworthy was that SVR presented a shift towards a proinflammatory pattern upon immunotherapy, assuming a pattern similar to that observed in NR and REL at baseline. Moreover, the immunotherapy guided REL towards a profile similar to SVR at baseline. Analysis of baseline-fold changes during treatment pointed out IFN-α and TNF as high-performance biomarkers to monitor immunotherapy outcome. This knowledge may contribute for novel insights into the treatment and control of the continuous public health threat posed by HCV infection worldwide. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 10; Correspondence Address: A.

Using Proportional Reporting Ratios, we identified signals that were further investigated with the literature to evaluate mechanistic hypotheses formed from the integrated FAERS data. Analysis revealed common pharmacological targets perturbed in both SGA and SS cases, indicating that SGAs may induce SS.

However, drug safety research has been progressing slowly in recent years, compared to other fields such as biotechnologies and precision medicine, due to the mechanistic complexity of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). To fill up this gap, we develop a new database, the Adverse Drug Reaction Classification System-Target Profile (ADReCS-Target, http://bioinf.xmu.edu.cn/ADReCSTarget), which provides comprehensive information about ADRs caused by drug interaction with protein, gene and genetic variation. In total, ADReCSTarget includes 66,573 pairwise relations, among which 1710 are protein-ADR associations, 2613 are genetic variation-ADR associations, and 63,298 are gene-ADR associations. In a case study of exploring the mechanism of rash, we find that HLAs, C1QA and APOA1 are the key gene players and thus can be potential targets (or biomarkers) in monitoring or countermining rashes. In summary, ADReCS-Target can be a useful resource for the biomedical scientific community by serving researchers in the fields of drug development, clinical pharmacology, precision medicine, and from web lab to high-throughput computational platform. Particularly, it helps to identify drug with better ADR profile and design safer drug therapy regimen. © 2017 The Author(s).","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 30; Correspondence Address: Z.-L.

However, vaccines are pharmaceutical products that carry risks so that many adverse events (AEs) are reported after receiving vaccines. Traditional adverse event reporting systems suffer from several crucial challenges including poor timeliness. This motivates increasing social media-based detection systems, which demonstrate successful capability to capture timely and prevalent disease information. Despite these advantages, social media-based AE detection suffers from serious challenges such as labor-intensive labeling and class imbalance of the training data. Results: To tackle both challenges from traditional reporting systems and social media, we exploit their complementary strength and develop a combinatorial classification approach by integrating Twitter data and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) information aiming to identify potential AEs after influenza vaccine. Specifically, we combine formal reports which have accurately predefined labels with social media data to reduce the cost of manual labeling; in order to combat the class imbalance problem, a max-rule based multi-instance learning method is proposed to bias positive users. Various experiments were conducted to validate our model compared with other baselines. We observed that (1) multi-instance learning methods outperformed baselines when only Twitter data were used; (2) formal reports helped improve the performance metrics of our multi-instance learning methods consistently while affecting the performance of other baselines negatively; (3) the effect of formal reports was more obvious when the training size was smaller. Case studies show that our model labeled users and tweets accurately. Conclusions: We have developed a framework to detect vaccine AEs by combining formal reports with social media data. We demonstrate the power of formal reports on the performance improvement of AE detection when the amount of social media data was small. Various experiments and case studies show the effectiveness of our model. © 2018 The Author(s).","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 16; Correspondence Address: Y.

Ultimately, a network of functional elements coupled 64 pulmonary fibrosis-associated genes into a novel, open-source AOP-linked molecular pathway, now available for commenting and improvements in WikiPathways (WP3624). Applying in silico-based knowledge extraction and modeling, the pipeline enabled screening and fusion of many different complex data types, including the integration of omics results.

Methods Using â ‰80 million concept-relationship-concept triples extracted from the literature using the SemRep Natural Language Processing system, distributed vector representations (embeddings) were generated for concepts as functions of their relationships utilizing two unsupervised representational approaches. Embeddings for drugs and side effects of interest from two widely used reference standards were then composed to generate embeddings of drug/side-effect pairs, which were used as input for supervised machine learning. This methodology was developed and evaluated using cross-validation strategies and compared to contemporary approaches. To qualitatively assess generalization, models trained on the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) drug/side-effect reference set were evaluated against a list of â ‰1100 drugs from an online database. Results The employed method improved performance over previous approaches. Cross-validation results advance the state of the art (AUC 0.96; F1 0.90 and AUC 0.95; F1 0.84 across the two sets), outperforming methods utilizing literature and/or spontaneous reporting system data. Examination of predictions for unseen drug/side-effect pairs indicates the ability of these methods to generalize, with over tenfold label support enrichment in the top 100 predictions versus the bottom 100 predictions. Discussion and Conclusion Our methods can assist the pharmacovigilance process using information from the biomedical literature. Unsupervised pretraining generates a rich relationship-based representational foundation for machine learning techniques to classify drugs in the context of a putative side effect, given known examples. © © The Author(s) 2018.

The objective of the study was to investigate reports of acute kidney injury (AKI) events associated with the concomitant use of oral acyclovir or valacyclovir with an NSAID by using the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) database between January 2004 and June 2012. The frequency of AKI events in patients while simultaneously taking either acyclovir or valacyclovir and an NSAID was compared using the Chi-square test. The effect of concomitant use of acyclovir or valacyclovir and individual NSAIDs on AKI was analyzed by the reporting odds ratio (ROR). The results showed that AKI was reported as the adverse event in 8.6% of the 10923 patients taking valacyclovir compared with 8.7% of the 2556 patients taking acyclovir (p=NS). However, AKI was significantly more frequently reported in patients simultaneously taking valacyclovir and an NSAID (19.4%) than in patients simultaneously taking acyclovir and an NSAID (10.5%) (p<0.01). The results also suggested that increased risk of AKI was likely associated with the concomitant use of valacyclovir and some NSAIDs such as loxoprofen, diclofenac, etodolac, ketorolac, piroxicam or lornoxicam. The case series from the AERS indicated that compared with acyclovir, valacyclovir is more likely to be affected by NSAIDs, and the concomitant use of valacyclovir with some NSAIDs might be associated with increased risk of AKI. The drug interactions with this specific combination of medications are worth exploring further. © 2018 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 16; Correspondence Address: Z.

Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are two important issues in pharmacovigilance, and how to detect drug safety signals has drawn many researchers’ attention and efforts. Currently, methods proposed for ADR and DDI detection are mainly based on traditional data sources such as spontaneous reporting data, electronic health records, pharmaceutical databases, and biomedical literature. However, these data sources are either limited by under-reporting ratio, privacy issues, high cost, or long publication cycle. In this study, we propose a framework for drug safety signal detection by harnessing online health community data, a timely, informative, and publicly available data source. Concretely, we used MedHelp as the data source to collect patient-contributed content based on which a weighted heterogeneous network was constructed. We extracted topological features from the network, quantified them with different weighting methods, and used supervised learning method for both ADR and DDI signal detection. In addition, after identifying DDI signals, we proposed a new metric, named Interaction Ratio, to identify associated ADRs due to suspected interactions. The experiment results showed that our proposed techniques outperforms baseline methods. © 2018","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 6; CODEN: AIMEE</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Mell""=>""Excluded"", ""Carolina""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Excluído - Não utiliza dados de farmacovigilância | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Dados de bases não oficiais",10.1016/j.artmed.2018.07.002,"Adverse drug reaction;Signal detection;Data Mining;data mining;Pharmacovigilance;heparin;Adverse drug reactions;Topology;Databases, Factual;Humans;Patient Safety;Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions;Drug Interactions;Drug safety;drug interaction;adverse drug reaction;Electronic health record;patient safety;supervised machine learning;electronic health record;human;medical literature;risk assessment;data base;factual database;procedures;risk factor;simvastatin;tacrolimus;fluoxetine;fluvoxamine maleate;drug surveillance program;lansoprazole;clarithromycin;social network;priority journal;medical information system;drug drug interaction;Article;Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems;Drug interactions;Drug-drug interactions;Risk Factors;Risk Assessment;Health;Online health communities;Adverse drug reaction (ADRs);Supervised Machine Learning;Heterogeneous networks;gadolinium;Health Information Exchange;Online Social Networking;recombinant erythropoietin;social network mining;Social network mining;Social network minings;Supervised learning methods",,

Methods: We identified 256 top-selling prescription drugs between 2003 and 2013 and divided them into 83 BBW drugs (drugs with at least one black box warning label) and 173 ROBUST drugs (drugs without any black box warning label) based on their FDA black box warning (BBW) records. We retrieved 7499 clinical trials that each had at least one of these drugs for intervention from the ClinicalTrials.gov. We stratified all the trials by pre-marketing or post-marketing status, study phase, and study start date. For each trial, we retrieved drug and disease concepts from clinical trial summaries to model its study population using medParser and SNOMED-CT. Convergent Focus Shift (CFS) pattern was calculated and used to assess the temporal changes in study populations from pre-marketing to post-marketing trials for each drug. Then we selected 68 candidate drugs, 18 with BBW warning and 50 without, that each had at least nine pre-marketing trials and nine post-marketing trials for predictive modeling. A random forest predictive model was developed to predict BBW acquisition incidents based on CFS patterns among these drugs. Pre- and post-marketing trials of BBW and ROBUST drugs were compared to look for their differences in CFS patterns. Results: Among the 18 BBW drugs, we consistently observed that the post-marketing trials focused more on recruiting patients with medical conditions previously unconsidered in the pre-marketing trials. In contrast, among the 50 ROBUST drugs, the post-marketing trials involved a variety of medications for testing their associations with target intervention(s). We found it feasible to predict BBW acquisitions using different CFS patterns between the two groups of drugs. Our random forest predictor achieved an AUC of 0.77. We also demonstrated the feasibility of the predictor for identifying long-term BBW acquisition events without compromising prediction accuracy. Conclusions: This study contributes a method for post-marketing pharmacovigilance using Convergent Focus Shift (CFS) patterns in clinical trial study populations mined from linked public data resources. These signals are otherwise unavailable from individual data resources. We demonstrated the added value of linked public data and the feasibility of integrating ClinicalTrials.gov summaries and drug safety labels for post-marketing surveillance.

As part of the eTOX project, a high number of these studies have been compiled and integrated into a database. This valuable resource can be queried directly, but it can be further exploited to build predictive models. As the studies were originally conducted to investigate the properties of individual compounds, the experimental conditions across the studies are highly heterogeneous. Consequently, the original data required normalization/standardization, filtering, categorization and integration to make possible any data analysis (such as building predictive models). Additionally, the primary objectives of the RDT studies were to identify toxicological findings, most of which do not directly translate to in vivo endpoints. This article describes a method to extract datasets containing comparable toxicological properties for a series of compounds amenable for building predictive models. The proposed strategy starts with the normalization of the terms used within the original reports. Then, comparable datasets are extracted from the database by applying filters based on the experimental conditions. Finally, carefully selected profiles of toxicological findings are mapped to endpoints of interest, generating QSAR-like tables. In this work, we describe in detail the strategy and tools used for carrying out these transformations and illustrate its application in a data sample extracted from the eTOX database. The suitability of the resulting tables for developing hazard-predicting models was investigated by building proof-of-concept models for in vivo liver endpoints. © The Author 2017.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: M.

However, existing sources of DDIs have the problems of low coverage, low accuracy and low agreement. One common type of DDIs is related to the mechanism of drug metabolism: a DDI relation may be caused by different interactions (e.g., substrate, inhibit) between drugs and enzymes in the drug metabolism process. Thus, information from drug enzyme interactions (DEIs) serves as important supportive evidence for DDIs. Further, potential DDIs present implicitly could be detected by inference and reasoning based on DEIs. Methods: In this article, we propose a hybrid approach to combining machine learning algorithm with trigger words and syntactic patterns, for DEI relation extraction from biomedical literature. The extracted DEI relations are used for reasoning to infer potential DDI relations, based on a defined drug-enzyme ontology incorporating biological knowledge. Results: Evaluation results demonstrate that the performance of DEI relation extraction is promising, with an F-measure of 84.97 % on the in vivo dataset and 65.58 % on the in vitro dataset. Further, the inferred DDIs achieved a precision of 83.19 % on the in vivo dataset and 70.94 % on the in vitro dataset, respectively. A further examination showed that the overlaps between our inferred DDIs and those present in DrugBank were 42.02 % on the in vivo dataset and 19.23 % on the in vitro dataset, respectively. Conclusions: This paper proposed an effective approach to extract DEI relations from biomedical literature. Potential DDIs not present in existing knowledge bases were then inferred based on the extracted DEIs, demonstrating the capability of the proposed approach to detect DDIs with scientific evidence for pharmacovigilance and drug repurposing applications. © 2016 Zhang et al.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 7; Correspondence Address: H.

The information of DDIs is crucial for healthcare professionals to prevent adverse drug events. Although some known DDIs can be found in purposely-built databases such as DrugBank, most information is still buried in scientific publications. Therefore, automatically extracting DDIs from biomedical texts is sorely needed. Methods and material: In this paper, we propose a novel position-aware deep multi-task learning approach for extracting DDIs from biomedical texts. In particular, sentences are represented as a sequence of word embeddings and position embeddings. An attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network is used to encode each sentence. The relative position information of words with the target drugs in text is combined with the hidden states of BiLSTM to generate the position-aware attention weights. Moreover, the tasks of predicting whether or not two drugs interact with each other and further distinguishing the types of interactions are learned jointly in multi-task learning framework. Results: The proposed approach has been evaluated on the DDIExtraction challenge 2013 corpus and the results show that with the position-aware attention only, our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 0.99% for binary DDI classification, and with both position-aware attention and multi-task learning, our approach achieves a micro F-score of 72.99% on interaction type identification, outperforming the state-of-the-art approach by 1.51%, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 73; Correspondence Address: D.

Over 40 drugs with both cardiac and non-cardiac indications are associated with increased risk of TdP, but drug–drug interactions contributing to LQTS (QT-DDIs) remain poorly characterized. Traditional methods for mining observational healthcare data are poorly equipped to detect QT-DDI signals due to low reporting numbers and lack of direct evidence for LQTS. Objective: We hypothesized that LQTS could be identified latently using an adverse event (AE) fingerprint of more commonly reported AEs. We aimed to generate an integrated data science pipeline that addresses current limitations by identifying latent signals for QT-DDIs in the US FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and retrospectively validating these predictions using electrocardiogram data in electronic health records (EHRs). Methods: We trained a model to identify an AE fingerprint for risk of TdP for single drugs and applied this model to drug pair data to predict novel DDIs. In the EHR at Columbia University Medical Center, we compared the QTc intervals of patients prescribed the flagged drug pairs with patients prescribed either drug individually. Results: We created an AE fingerprint consisting of 13 latently detected side effects. This model significantly outperformed a direct evidence control model in the detection of established interactions (p = 1.62E−3) and significantly enriched for validated QT-DDIs in the EHR (p = 0.01). Of 889 pairs flagged in FAERS, eight novel QT-DDIs were significantly associated with prolonged QTc intervals in the EHR and were not due to co-prescribed medications. Conclusions: Latent signal detection in FAERS validated using the EHR presents an automated and data-driven approach for systematically identifying novel QT-DDIs. The high-confidence hypotheses flagged using this method warrant further investigation. © 2016, The Author(s).","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 30; Correspondence Address: N.P.

Objective: To assess adverse events (AEs) after HDCV reported to the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a spontaneous reporting surveillance system. Methods: We searched VAERS for US reports after HDCV among persons vaccinated from January 1, 1990–July 31, 2015. Medical records were requested for reports classified as serious (death, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, disability, life-threatening-illness), and those suggesting anaphylaxis and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Physicians reviewed available information and assigned a primary clinical category to each report using MedDRA system organ classes. Empirical Bayesian (EB) data mining was used to identify disproportional AE reporting after HDCV. Results: VAERS received 1,611 reports after HDCV; 93 (5.8%) were serious. Among all reports, the three most common AEs included pyrexia (18.2%), headache (17.9%), and nausea (16.5%). Among serious reports, four deaths appeared to be unrelated to vaccination. Conclusions: This 25-year review of VAERS did not identify new or unexpected AEs after HDCV. The vast majority of AEs were non-serious.

Meta-analysis techniques allow integrating data from multiple studies that are related but independent in order to identify biomarkers across multiple conditions. However, existing biomarker meta-analysis methods tend to be sensitive to the dataset being analyzed. Here, we propose a meta-analysis method, iMeta, which integrates t-statistic and fold change ratio for improved robustness. For evaluation of predictive performance of the biomarkers identified by iMeta, we compare our method with other meta-analysis methods. As a result, iMeta outperforms the other methods in terms of sensitivity and specificity, and especially shows robustness to study variance increase; it consistently shows higher classification accuracy on diverse datasets, while the performance of the others is highly affected by the dataset being analyzed. Application of iMeta to 59 drug-induced liver injury studies identified three key biomarker genes: Zwint, Abcc3, and Ppp1r3b. Experimental evaluation using RT-PCR and qRT-PCR shows that their expressional changes in response to drug toxicity are concordant with the result of our method. iMeta is available at http://imeta.kaist.ac.kr/index.html. © 2016 The Authors.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 13; Correspondence Address: D.

We assessed the presence of major birth defects following vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a national spontaneous reporting system used to monitor the safety of vaccines in the United States. Methods: We searched VAERS for reports of major birth defects during January 1, 1990, through December 31, 2014. We excluded birth defects from vaccines that had been studied in pregnancy registries or other epidemiological studies (e.g., human papilloma virus, varicella, measles/mumps/rubella, and anthrax vaccines). Birth defects were categorized into trimester of vaccination and classified based on the organs and/or systems affected. If several birth defects affecting different systems were described, we classified those as multiple body systems. Empirical Bayesian data mining was used to assess for disproportionate reporting. Results: We identified 50 reports of major birth defects; in 28 reports, the vaccine was given during the first trimester; 25 were reports with single vaccines administered. Birth defects accounted for 0.03% of all reports received by VAERS during the study period and 3.2% of pregnancy reports; reported defects affected predominately the musculoskeletal (N = 10) or nervous (N = 10) systems. No unusual clusters or specific birth defects were identified. Conclusion: This review of the VAERS database found that major birth defects were infrequently reported, with no particular condition reported disproportionally. Birth defects after routine maternal vaccination will continue to be monitored in VAERS for signals to prompt future studies.

Reports of hepatitis B infection were retrieved from the FAERS database. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) was used to estimate the association between hepatitis B infection and various anticancer agents and drug combinations. We detected statistically significant risk signals of hepatitis B for 33 of 64 anticancer agents by ROR (26 cytotoxicity drugs and seven molecular-targeted drugs). We focused on molecular-targeted drugs and assessed the risk of hepatitis B from specific anticancer drug combinations. The frequency of hepatitis B infection was significantly high for drugs such as rituximab, bortezomib, imatinib, and everolimus. The addition of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fludarabine to drug combinations additively enhanced the frequency of hepatitis B infection. There were no reports on hepatitis B infection associated with trastuzumab or azacitidine monotherapy. However, trastuzumab-containing regimens (e.g., combinations with docetaxel or paclitaxel) were correlated with the incidence of hepatitis B infection, similar to azacitidine monotherapy. Our findings suggest that the concomitant use of anticancer drugs, such as trastuzumab, taxane, and azacitidine, may contribute to the risk of hepatitis B infection. The unique signals detected from the public database might provide clues to eliminate the threat of HBV in oncology. © 2018 The Authors.

Live-attenuated HZ vaccine (zoster vaccine live, ZVL) is approved in the United States for persons aged ≥50 years and recommended by the CDC for persons ≥60 years. Methods: We analyzed U.S. reports of adverse events (AEs) following ZVL submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a spontaneous reporting system to monitor vaccine safety, for persons vaccinated May 1, 2006, through January 31, 2015. We conducted descriptive analysis, clinical reviews of reports with selected pre-specified conditions, and empirical Bayesian data mining. Results: VAERS received 23,092 reports following ZVL, of which 22,120 (96%) were classified as non-serious. Of reports where age was documented (n = 18,817), 83% were in persons aged ≥60 years. Reporting rates of AEs were 106 and 4.4 per 100,000 ZVL doses distributed for all reports and serious reports, respectively. When ZVL was administered alone among persons aged ≥50 years, injection site erythema (27%), HZ (17%), injection site swelling (17%), and rash (14%) were the most commonly reported symptoms among non-serious reports; HZ (29%), pain (18%), and rash (16%) were the most commonly reported symptoms among serious reports. Six reports included laboratory evidence of vaccine-strain varicella-zoster virus (Oka/Merck strain) infection; AEs included HZ, HZor varicella-like illness, and local reaction with vesicles. In our review of reports of death with sufficient information to determine cause (n = 46, median age 75 years), the most common causes were heart disease (n = 28), sepsis (n = 4), and stroke (n = 3). Empirical Bayesian data mining did not detect new or unexpected safety signals. Conclusions: Findings from our safety review of ZVL are consistent with those from pre-licensure clinical trials and other post-licensure assessments. Transient injection-site reactions, HZ, and rashes were most frequently reported to VAERS following ZVL. Overall, our results are reassuring regarding the safety of ZVL. © 2018, Taylor and Francis Inc. All rights reserved.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 26; Correspondence Address: E.R.

Objective: This study aimed to provide a comparable corpus of texts from PubMed and Twitter that can be used to study drug reports from these two sources of information, allowing researchers in the area of pharmacovigilance using natural language processing (NLP) to perform experiments to better understand the similarities and differences between drug reports in Twitter and PubMed. Methods: We produced a corpus comprising 1000 tweets and 1000 PubMed sentences selected using the same strategy and annotated at entity level by the same experts (pharmacists) using the same set of guidelines. Results: The resulting corpus, annotated by two pharmacists, comprises semantically correct annotations for a set of drugs, diseases, and symptoms. This corpus contains the annotations for 3144 entities, 2749 relations, and 5003 attributes. Conclusions: We present a corpus that is unique in its characteristics as this is the first corpus for pharmacovigilance curated from Twitter messages and PubMed sentences using the same data selection and annotation strategies. We believe this corpus will be of particular interest for researchers willing to compare results from pharmacovigilance systems (eg, classifiers and named entity recognition systems) when using data from Twitter and from PubMed. We hope that given the comprehensive set of drug names and the annotated entities and relations, this corpus becomes a standard resource to compare results from different pharmacovigilance studies in the area of NLP. © Nestor Alvaro, Yusuke Miyao, Nigel Collier.

However, limited post-licensure safety assessment has been conducted. Objective: To analyze reports submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) following PPSV23 from 1990 to 2013 in order to characterize its safety profile. Methods: We searched the VAERS database for US reports following PPSV23 for persons vaccinated from 1990 to 2013. We assessed safety through: automated analysis of VAERS data, crude adverse event (AE) reporting rates based on PPSV23 doses distributed in the US market, clinical review of death reports and reports involving vaccine administered to pregnant women, and empirical Bayesian data mining to assess for disproportional reporting. Results: During the study period, VAERS received 25,168 PPSV23 reports; 92% were non-serious, 67% were in females and 86% were in adults aged ≥19 years. When PPSV23 was administered alone, fever (43%), injection site erythema (28%) and injection site pain (25%) were the most commonly reported non-serious AEs in children. Injection site erythema (32%), injection site pain (27%) and injection site swelling (23%) were the most commonly reported non-serious AEs in adults. Of serious reports (2129, 8% of total), fever was most commonly reported in both children (69%) and adults (39%). There were 66 reports of death, four in children and 62 in adults. Clinical review of death reports did not reveal any concerning patterns that would suggest a causal association with PPSV23. No disproportional reporting of unexpected AEs was observed in empirical Bayesian data mining. Conclusions: We did not identify any new or unexpected safety concerns for PPSV23.

In this study, we propose automatic data labeling by distant supervision where knowledge bases are exploited to assign an entity-level relation label for each drug-event pair in texts, and then, we use patterns for characterizing ADR relation. The multiple-instance learning with expectation-maximization method is employed to estimate model parameters. The method applies transductive learning to iteratively reassign a probability of unknown drug-event pair at the training time. By investigating experiments with 50,998 discharge summaries, we evaluate our method by varying large number of parameters, that is, pattern types, pattern-weighting models, and initial and iterative weightings of relations for unlabeled data. Based on evaluations, our proposed method outperforms the word-based feature for NB-EM (iEM), MILR, and TSVM with F1 score of 11.3%, 9.3%, and 6.5% improvement, respectively. © 2017 Siriwon Taewijit et al.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 9; Correspondence Address: S.

We reviewed reports of adverse events (AEs) to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to assess safety in all age groups. Methods VAERS is a national spontaneous vaccine safety surveillance system co-administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Food and Drug Administration. We searched the VAERS database for US reports of adverse events in persons who received Menveo from 1 January 2010 through 31 December 2015. We clinically reviewed reports and available medical records for serious AEs, selected pre-specified outcomes, and vaccination during pregnancy. We used empirical Bayesian data mining to identify AEs that were disproportionately reported after receipt of Menveo. Results During the study period, VAERS received 2614 US reports after receipt of Menveo. Of these, 67 were classified as serious, including 1 report of death. Adolescents (aged 11–18 years) accounted for 74% of reports. Most of the reported AEs were non-serious and described AEs consistent with data from pre-licensure studies. Anaphylaxis and syncope were the two most common events in the serious reports. We did not identify any new safety concerns after review of AEs that exceeded the data mining threshold, although we did observe disproportionate reporting for terms that were not associated with an adverse event (e.g., “incorrect drug dosage form administered”, “wrong technique in drug usage process”). Although reports were limited, we did not find any evidence for concern regarding the use of Menveo during pregnancy. Conclusions In our review of VAERS reports, findings of AEs were consistent with the data from pre-licensure studies. Vaccine providers should continue to emphasize and adhere to proper administration of the vaccine. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 28; Correspondence Address: T.R.

This makes it a good candidate for public-health monitoring tasks, specifically for pharmacovigilance. We study the problem of extraction of Adverse-Drug-Reaction (ADR) mentions from social media, particularly from Twitter. Medical information extraction from social media is challenging, mainly due to short and highly informal nature of text, as compared to more technical and formal medical reports. Methods: Current methods in ADR mention extraction rely on supervised learning methods, which suffer from labeled data scarcity problem. The state-of-the-art method uses deep neural networks, specifically a class of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which is Long-Short-Term-Memory network (LSTM). Deep neural networks, due to their large number of free parameters rely heavily on large annotated corpora for learning the end task. But in the real-world, it is hard to get large labeled data, mainly due to the heavy cost associated with the manual annotation. Results: To this end, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning based RNN model, which can leverage unlabeled data also present in abundance on social media. Through experiments we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance in ADR mention extraction. Conclusion: In this study, we tackle the problem of labeled data scarcity for Adverse Drug Reaction mention extraction from social media and propose a novel semi-supervised learning based method which can leverage large unlabeled corpus available in abundance on the web. Through empirical study, we demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms fully supervised learning based baseline which relies on large manually annotated corpus for a good performance. © 2018 The Author(s).","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 42; Correspondence Address: S.

Challenges and opportunities now lie in developing analytic tools to transform these often complex and heterogeneous data into testable hypotheses and actionable insights. This is the aim of computational pharmacology, which uses in silico techniques to better understand and predict how drugs affect biological systems, which can in turn improve clinical use, avoid unwanted side effects, and guide selection and development of better treatments. One exciting application of computational pharmacology is drug repurposing-finding new uses for existing drugs. Already yielding many promising candidates, this strategy has the potential to improve the efficiency of the drug development process and reach patient populations with previously unmet needs such as those with rare diseases. While current techniques in computational pharmacology and drug repurposing often focus on just a single data modality such as gene expression or drug-target interactions, we argue that methods such as matrix factorization that can integrate data within and across diverse data types have the potential to improve predictive performance and provide a fuller picture of a drug's pharmacological action. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 277; Correspondence Address: J.T.

METHODS: We searched VAERS for US reports of DTaP vaccinations occurring from January 1, 1991, through December 31, 2016, and received by March 17, 2017. We reviewed available medical records for all death reports and a random sample of reports classified as nondeath serious. We used Empirical Bayesian data mining to identify adverse events that were disproportionally reported after DTaP vaccination. RESULTS: VAERS received 50 157 reports after DTaP vaccination; 43 984 (87.7%) of them reported concomitant administration of other vaccines, and 5627 (11.2%) were serious. Median age at vaccination was 19 months (interquartile range 35 months). The most frequently reported events were injection site erythema (12 695; 25.3%), pyrexia (9913; 19.8%), injection site swelling (7542; 15.0%), erythema (5599; 11.2%), and injection site warmth (4793; 9.6%). For 3 of the DTaP vaccines, we identified elevated values for vaccination errors using Empirical Bayesian data mining. CONCLUSIONS: No new or unexpected adverse events were detected. The observed disproportionate reporting for some nonserious vaccination errors calls for better education of vaccine providers on the specific indications for each of the DTaP vaccines.

In order to enrich the scientific evidence and enhance the detection of emerging adverse drug events that can lead to unintended harmful outcomes, pharmacovigilance activities need to evolve to encompass novel complementary data streams, for example the biomedical literature available through MEDLINE. Objectives: (1) To review how the characteristics of MEDLINE indexing influence the identification of adverse drug events (ADEs); (2) to leverage this knowledge to inform the design of a system for extracting ADEs from MEDLINE indexing; and (3) to assess the specific contribution of some characteristics of MEDLINE indexing to the performance of this system. Methods: We analyze the characteristics of MEDLINE indexing. We integrate three specific characteristics into the design of a system for extracting ADEs from MEDLINE indexing. We experimentally assess the specific contribution of these characteristics over a baseline system based on co-occurrence between drug descriptors qualified by adverse effects and disease descriptors qualified by chemically induced. Results: Our system extracted 405,300 ADEs from 366,120 MEDLINE articles. The baseline system accounts for 297,093 ADEs (73%). 85,318 ADEs (21%) can be extracted only after integrating specific pre-coordinated MeSH descriptors and additional qualifiers. 22,889 ADEs (6%) can be extracted only after considering indirect links between the drug of interest and the descriptor that bears the ADE context. Conclusions: In this paper, we demonstrate significant improvement over a baseline approach to identifying ADEs from MEDLINE indexing, which mitigates some of the inherent limitations of MEDLINE indexing for pharmacovigilance. ADEs extracted from MEDLINE indexing are complementary to, not a replacement for, other sources. © 2015.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 20; Correspondence Address: O.

Physician information-seeking behavior has typically been analyzed through survey-based approaches and literature reviews. Activity logs from health care professionals using online medical information resources are thus a valuable yet relatively untapped resource for large-scale medical surveillance. Objective: To analyze health care professionals' information-seeking behavior and assess the feasibility of measuring drug-safety alert response from the usage logs of an online medical information resource. Methods: Using two years (2011-2012) of usage logs from UpToDate, we measured the volume of searches related to medical conditions with significant burden in the United States, as well as the seasonal distribution of those searches. We quantified the relationship between searches and resulting page views. Using a large collection of online mainstream media articles and Web log posts we also characterized the uptake of a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) alert via changes in UpToDate search activity compared with general online media activity related to the subject of the alert. Results: Diseases and symptoms dominate UpToDate searches. Some searches result in page views of only short duration, while others consistently result in longer-than-average page views. The response to an FDA alert for Celexa, characterized by a change in UpToDate search activity, differed considerably from general online media activity. Changes in search activity appeared later and persisted longer in UpToDate logs. The volume of searches and page view durations related to Celexa before the alert also differed from those after the alert. Conclusions: Understanding the information-seeking behavior associated with online evidence sources can offer insight into the information needs of health professionals and enable large-scale medical surveillance. Our Web log mining approach has the potential to monitor responses to FDA alerts at a national level. Our findings can also inform the design and content of evidence-based medical information resources such as UpToDate. ©Alison Callahan, Igor Pernek, Gregor Stiglic, Jure Leskovec, Howard R Strasberg, Nigam Haresh Shah.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 8; Correspondence Address: A.

Objective: To assess adverse events (AEs) after ccIIV3 reported to the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a spontaneous reporting surveillance system. Methods: We searched VAERS for US reports after ccIIV3 among persons vaccinated from July 1, 2013-March 31, 2015. Medical records were requested for reports classified as serious (death, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, disability, life-threatening-illness), and those suggesting anaphylaxis and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Physicians reviewed available information and assigned a primary clinical category using MedDRA system organ classes (SOC) to each report. Empirical Bayesian data mining was used to identify disproportional AE reporting following ccIIV3. Results: VAERS received 629 reports following ccIIV3 of which 313 were for administration of vaccine to persons <18 years. Among 309 reports with an AE documented, 19 (6.1%) were serious and the most common categories were 152 (49.2%) general disorders and administration site conditions (mostly injection site and systemic reactions) and 73 (23.6%) immune system disorders with two reports of anaphylaxis. Four reports of GBS were submitted. Disproportional reporting was identified for 'drug administered to patient of inappropriate age.' Conclusions: Review of VAERS reports did not identify any concerning pattern of AEs after ccIIV3. Injection site and systemic reactions were the most commonly reported AEs, similar to the pre-licensure clinical trials.

Recently, a decreased risk of cancer associated with sodium channel-blocking antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) has become a research focus of interest. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the use of sodium channel-blocking AEDs are inversely associated with cancer, using different methodologies, algorithms, and databases. Methods: A total of 65,146,507 drug-reaction pairs from the first quarter of 2004 through the end of 2013 were downloaded from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information component (IC) were used to detect an inverse association between AEDs and cancer. Upper limits of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of < 1 and < 0 for the ROR and IC, respectively, signified inverse associations. Furthermore, using a claims database, which contains 3 million insured persons, an event sequence symmetry analysis (ESSA) was performed to identify an inverse association between AEDs and cancer over the period of January 2005 to May 2014. The upper limit of the 95% CI of adjusted sequence ratio (ASR) < 1 signified an inverse association. Results: In the FAERS database analyses, significant inverse associations were found between sodium channel-blocking AEDs and individual cancers. In the claims database analyses, sodium channel-blocking AED use was inversely associated with diagnoses of colorectal cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer, and hematological malignancies, with ASRs of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.60 – 0.86), 0.65 (0.51 – 0.81), 0.80 (0.65 – 0.98), and 0.50 (0.37 – 0.66), respectively. Positive associations between sodium channel-blocking AEDs and cancer were not found in the study. Conclusion: Multi-methodological approaches using different methodologies, algorithms, and databases suggest that sodium channel-blocking AED use is inversely associated with colorectal cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer, and hematological malignancies. © 2015 Ivyspring International Publisher.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 35; Correspondence Address: M.

However, it remains uncertain whether statin therapy is associated with cancer risk. To examine the association between statin use and the risk of cancer, we conducted data mining using the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and a large organized database of claims constructed by a database vendor (The Japan Medical Data Center Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan [JMDC]). Methods: Relevant reports in the FAERS, which included data from the first quarter of 2004 through the end of 2012, were identified and analyzed. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) was used to detect spontaneous report signals and was calculated using the case/non-case method. Additionally, signals were detected via the information component (IC) using the IC025 metric. Furthermore, event sequence symmetry analysis (ESSA) was applied to identify the risk of cancer following treatment with statins over the period January 2005 to July 2013. Results: In the FAERS database analyses, significant signals for colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer were found for statins as a class. In the ESSA, significant associations between statin use and colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer were found, with adjusted sequence ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 1.20 (1.08-1.34) and 1.31 (1.13-1.53), respectively, at an interval of 48 months.

We participated in all subtasks of this challenge. In this article, we present our participation system Chemical Disease Relation Extraction SysTem (CD-REST), an end-to-end system for extracting chemical-induced disease relations in biomedical literature. CD-REST consists of two main components: (1) a chemical and disease named entity recognition and normalization module, which employs the Conditional Random Fields algorithm for entity recognition and a Vector Space Model-based approach for normalization; and (2) a relation extraction module that classifies both sentence-level and document-level candidate drug-disease pairs by support vector machines. Our system achieved the best performance on the chemical-induced disease relation extraction subtask in the BioCreative V CDR Track, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed machine learning-based approaches for automatic extraction of chemical-induced disease relations in biomedical literature.

Data modeling with those two process in MDA should be repeated fast in order to verify the data model and to find a new data resource for a service. Our first research goal of big data application is to predict side effect of drug which is one of screening methods in drug discovery. This prediction model is constructed with data mining methods at the intersection of statistics, machine learning and database system. Moreover, a new service for drug discovery by new uses for old drugs can be found in data modeling and developed.

Adverse drug events, which can be encoded in EHRs with certain diagnosis codes, are, however, heavily underreported. It is therefore important to develop capabilities to process, by means of computational methods, the more unstructured EHR data in the form of clinical notes, where clinicians may describe and reason around suspected ADEs. In this study, we report on the creation of an annotated corpus of Swedish health records for the purpose of learning to identify information pertaining to ADEs present in clinical notes. To this end, three key tasks are tackled: recognizing relevant named entities (disorders, symptoms, drugs), labeling attributes of the recognized entities (negation, speculation, temporality), and relationships between them (indication, adverse drug event). For each of the three tasks, leveraging models of distributional semantics - i.e., unsupervised methods that exploit co-occurrence information to model, typically in vector space, the meaning of words - and, in particular, combinations of such models, is shown to improve the predictive performance. The ability to make use of such unsupervised methods is critical when faced with large amounts of sparse and high-dimensional data, especially in domains where annotated resources are scarce. © 2015 The Authors.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 80; Correspondence Address: A.

The aim of this study was to develop an application to identify instances of Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) from free text psychiatric EHRs. Methods We used the GATE Natural Language Processing (NLP) software to mine instances of ADEs from free text content within the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) system, a de-identified psychiatric case register developed at the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, UK. The tool was built around a set of four movement disorders (extrapyramidal side effects [EPSEs]) related to antipsychotic therapy and rules were then generalised such that the tool could be applied to additional ADEs. We report the frequencies of recorded EPSEs in patients diagnosed with a Severe Mental Illness (SMI) and then report performance in identifying eight other unrelated ADEs. Results The tool identified EPSEs with >0.85 precision and >0.86 recall during testing. Akathisia was found to be the most prevalent EPSE overall and occurred in the Asian ethnic group with a frequency of 8.13%. The tool performed well when applied to most of the non-EPSEs but least well when applied to rare conditions such as myocarditis, a condition that appears frequently in the text as a side effect warning to patients. Conclusions The developed tool allows us to accurately identify instances of a potential ADE from psychiatric EHRs. As such, we were able to study the prevalence of ADEs within subgroups of patients stratified by SMI diagnosis, gender, age and ethnicity. In addition we demonstrated the generalisability of the application to other ADE types by producing a high precision rate on a non-EPSE related set of ADE containing documents.

Data on adverse event reactions (AERs) submitted to U.S. FDA was used. Six ADRs associated with 6 drugs (rosuvastatin, aripiprazole, teriparatide, telithromycin, exenatide, varenicline) were investigated: Changes in the proportional reporting ratio, reporting odds ratio, and information component as indexes of signal detection were followed every 3 months after each drugs release, and the time for detection of signals was investigated. The time for the detection of signal to be detected after drug release in the USA was 2-10 months for known ADRs and 19-44 months for unknown ones. The median lag time for known and unknown ADRs was 99.0-122.5 days and 185.5-306.0 days, respectively. When the FDA released advisory information on rare but potentially serious health risks of an unknown ADR, the time lag to report from the onset of ADRs to the FDA was shorter.

Limited data exist on the safety of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine in adults. We reviewed reports of adverse events (AEs) to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to assess safety in this previously understudied group. Methods. VAERS is the national spontaneous vaccine safety surveillance system coadministered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Food and Drug Administration. We searched the VAERS database for US reports of adults aged 19 years who received the MMR vaccine from 1 January 2003 to 31 July 2013. We clinically reviewed reports and available medical records for serious AEs, pregnancy reports, and reports for selected prespecified outcomes. Results. During this period, VAERS received 3175 US reports after MMR vaccine in adults. Of these, 168 (5%) were classified as serious, including 7 reports of death. Females accounted for 77% of reports. The most common signs and symptoms for all reports were pyrexia (19%), rash (17%), pain (13%), and arthralgia (13%). We did not detect any new safety findings in empirical Bayesian data mining. We identified 131 reports of MMR vaccine administered to a pregnant woman; the majority of these vaccinations were in the first trimester and in 83 (62%), no AE was reported. Conclusions. In our review of VAERS data, we did not detect any new or unexpected safety concerns for MMR vaccination in adults. We identified reports of pregnant women exposed to MMR, which is a group in whom the vaccine is contraindicated, suggesting the need for continued provider education on vaccine recommendations and screening. © 2015 The Author.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 47; Correspondence Address: L.

Our goal is to estimate each individual risk of adding a new drug to an existing drug combination. In this proof-of-concept study, we analyzed a large electronic medical records database and extracted myopathy-relevant case control drug co-occurrence data. We applied frequent itemset mining to discover frequent drug combinations within the extracted data, evaluated directional drug interactions related to these combinations, and identified directional drug interactions with large effect sizes. Furthermore, we developed a novel visualization method to organize multiple directional drug interaction effects depicted as a tree, to generate an intuitive graphical and visual representation of our data-mining results. This translational bioinformatics approach yields promising results, adds valuable and complementary information to the existing pharmacovigilance literature, and has the potential to impact clinical practice. © 2015 The Authors CPT: Pharmacometrics and Systems Pharmacology published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","<p>Export Date: 16 July 2025; Cited By: 12; Correspondence Address: L.
